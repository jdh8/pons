# 21GF ledger — pons 2/1 vs BBA's `21GF.bbsa`

Target spec for "author pons's 2/1 about as deep as BBA". One row per relevant
`vendor/bba/21GF.bbsa` toggle. The plan that governs this work:
`~/.claude/plans/author-the-2-1-bidding-replicated-mochi.md`.

**Status legend:** `shipped` (authored + tested) · `partial` (some of it) ·
`floor` (handled by `instinct()` only, not authored) · `gap` (absent) ·
`conflict` (pons plays it differently) · `override` (user chose ≠ 21GF) ·
`out` (out of scope).

**Campaign metric:** `examples/bba-match` IMPs/board vs BBA 2/1. Original baseline
**−2.59** (2000 boards); fresh re-measure **−1.997** (4000 boards, CI
[−2.16, −1.83], 81% divergent) — gap already narrowed by recent M6.1 work. Trend
it up as batches land. Worst-board themes: competitive doubles/advances +
balancing/reopening, and slam accuracy (missed grands).

## Locked decisions (from planning dialogue)

1. Mirror `21GF.bbsa` ON toggles; author by IMP-priority; user vetoes per item.
2. Shipped conflicts: keep pons's, A/B head-to-head; switch only if BBA wins.
3. Keycard: **keep 1430** (not 0314).
4. Jump shifts: **keep weak**; fit-showing only as a competition gadget later.
5. Beyond-21GF additions in scope: **plain-4NT minor keycard**, **Garbage Stayman**.
6. Out of scope: Multi 2♦, Benjamin/French 2D, Gambling, Gazzilli, Ghestem,
   Raptor 1NT, plain Landy, Polish/Wilkosz, Kickback/Crosswood.
7. Overrides: **Woolsey** over their 1NT (≠ Cappelletti); **Rubensohl /
   transfer-Lebensohl SEF-2018+** over interference on our 1NT (≠ Lebensohl).
8. **Kickback** postponed to its own session (spec in the plan).

**Transfer Lebensohl (80) — Rubensohl take 2, shipped as default.** The first
Rubensohl attempt lost (−1.68/div) by stranding game hands in partscores. Larry
Cohen's *Transfer Lebensohl* fixes that: after `1NT–(2X)` the 3-level bids are
transfers up the line *through* the adverse suit (over `(2♥)`, `3♦` shows
spades), the cue is Stayman, and a transfer to a suit above theirs is INV+ so
opener is **driven to game** (`4M` with a fit, else `3NT`) — the anti-stranding
rule the user specified. Weak hands keep the plain outlets (natural 2-level,
`2NT` relay, penalty double). A/B (`lebensohl-ab`, `--ns transfer`, 200k
boards/cell): **+0.46/+1.24 IMPs/divergent (none/both) vs plain** (the incumbent
default) and +0.35/+0.05 vs the bare floor — reversing v1's loss. Selected by
`LebensohlStyle` (`set_lebensohl_style`); `Transfer` is the default, `Plain` kept
for the A/B and as a fallback. Unlike the preemptive conventions below, the win
is mostly *constructive* (reaching the right game / strain), which the
DD / perfect-defense measure can see; the right-siding (strong `1NT` hand
declares) is invisible on top, so the table value is higher still.

**Naming + the TransferSmolen experiment (80, follow-up — tried & reverted).**
*Rubensohl* proper makes `2NT` an artificial **club** transfer; what ships keeps
the weak `2NT` **relay**, so it is *Transfer Lebensohl* (Cohen). A **TransferSmolen**
hybrid — Cohen over `(2♠)` but the *standard low-Stayman* structure over `(2♦)`/`(2♥)`
(the bid into their suit is Stayman, `3♣`/`3♦`, freeing a Smolen continuation) — was
authored and A/B'd vs `Transfer`. First pass read −0.7/div but was contaminated by a
too-tight Stayman gate (single-4-card-major hands stranded into a penalty double);
after loosening the gate (fire on one 4-card major) the **fair re-test was
−1.31/−1.76 IMPs/div (none/both, 300k filtered)** — a clear loss. Standard low-Stayman
reaches DD-worse contracts than Cohen's cue=Stayman (e.g. a 5-5 hand routes through
Stayman→denial→`3NT`, missing the 5-3 major game Cohen's transfer-*through* finds), and
Smolen's right-siding is DD-blind. **Reverted.** The deferred `2NT`-role A/B (clubs =
Rubensohl vs relay = Transfer Lebensohl) is independent — it can be run on the Cohen
structure. `lebensohl-ab` kept a cheap `--filter-dh` shape pre-filter (concentrates
`1NT–(2♦/2♥)` boards ~10× so DD lands on boards that can diverge) + a worst-board
auction diagnostic.

**Jordan/Truscott (71) — tried and rejected (DD-negative).** Authored
`1M–(X)–2NT` = limit-raise-or-better + `3M` = preemptive, with opener's decline
path (`2NT`→`3M` sign-off, responder pass/4M) and a sound `2NT` strength
inference; reused the uncontested `major_responses` for every non-Jordan call;
gated by `set_jordan`. A/B'd vs the system-on baseline (`jordan-ab`, contested
seat-swap duplicate, `Family::NATURAL` opponents take out double our major).
Result: **−1.0/−1.5 IMPs/divergent** (full package, 500k boards, none/both) and
**−4.2/−4.4** (the `2NT`-constructive half alone, 300k). Two causes, both inherent
to the harness: (1) the preemptive `3M`'s obstruction value is invisible to the
double-dummy / perfect-defense measure (the solver sees through it — cf.
`texas-vs-sat` "concealment is single-dummy"), while its overbid cost is counted;
(2) making `2NT` limit-or-better diverts 13+ game-forcing raises out of pons's
rich **Jacoby 2NT** machinery (shortness / slam) into a crude `3M/4M` stub,
reaching worse games and missed slams that the doubler punishes. **Reverted** —
the floor's system-on (`2NT` = Jacoby, `3M` = limit raise) stays. Revisit only
under a single-dummy / IMPs-vs-humans measure where preemption actually pays.
