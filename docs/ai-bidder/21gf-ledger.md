# 21GF ledger — pons 2/1 vs BBA's `21GF.bbsa`

Target spec for "author pons's 2/1 about as deep as BBA". One row per relevant
`vendor/bba/21GF.bbsa` toggle. The plan that governs this work:
`~/.claude/plans/author-the-2-1-bidding-replicated-mochi.md`.

**Status legend:** `shipped` (authored + tested) · `partial` (some of it) ·
`floor` (handled by `instinct()` only, not authored) · `gap` (absent) ·
`conflict` (pons plays it differently) · `override` (user chose ≠ 21GF) ·
`out` (out of scope).

**Campaign metric:** `examples/bba-match` IMPs/board vs BBA 2/1. Original baseline
**−2.59** (2000 boards); fresh re-measure **−1.997** (4000 boards, CI
[−2.16, −1.83], 81% divergent) — gap already narrowed by recent M6.1 work. Trend
it up as batches land. Worst-board themes: competitive doubles/advances +
balancing/reopening, and slam accuracy (missed grands).

## Locked decisions (from planning dialogue)

1. Mirror `21GF.bbsa` ON toggles; author by IMP-priority; user vetoes per item.
2. Shipped conflicts: keep pons's, A/B head-to-head; switch only if BBA wins.
3. Keycard: **keep 1430** (not 0314).
4. Jump shifts: **keep weak**; fit-showing only as a competition gadget later.
5. Beyond-21GF additions in scope: **plain-4NT minor keycard**, **Garbage Stayman**.
6. Out of scope: Multi 2♦, Benjamin/French 2D, Gambling, Gazzilli, Ghestem,
   Raptor 1NT, plain Landy, Polish/Wilkosz, Kickback/Crosswood.
7. Overrides: **Woolsey** over their 1NT (≠ Cappelletti); **Rubensohl /
   transfer-Lebensohl SEF-2018+** over interference on our 1NT (≠ Lebensohl).
8. **Kickback** postponed to its own session (spec in the plan).

**Jordan/Truscott (71) — tried and rejected (DD-negative).** Authored
`1M–(X)–2NT` = limit-raise-or-better + `3M` = preemptive, with opener's decline
path (`2NT`→`3M` sign-off, responder pass/4M) and a sound `2NT` strength
inference; reused the uncontested `major_responses` for every non-Jordan call;
gated by `set_jordan`. A/B'd vs the system-on baseline (`jordan-ab`, contested
seat-swap duplicate, `Family::NATURAL` opponents take out double our major).
Result: **−1.0/−1.5 IMPs/divergent** (full package, 500k boards, none/both) and
**−4.2/−4.4** (the `2NT`-constructive half alone, 300k). Two causes, both inherent
to the harness: (1) the preemptive `3M`'s obstruction value is invisible to the
double-dummy / perfect-defense measure (the solver sees through it — cf.
`texas-vs-sat` "concealment is single-dummy"), while its overbid cost is counted;
(2) making `2NT` limit-or-better diverts 13+ game-forcing raises out of pons's
rich **Jacoby 2NT** machinery (shortness / slam) into a crude `3M/4M` stub,
reaching worse games and missed slams that the doubler punishes. **Reverted** —
the floor's system-on (`2NT` = Jacoby, `3M` = limit raise) stays. Revisit only
under a single-dummy / IMPs-vs-humans measure where preemption actually pays.
