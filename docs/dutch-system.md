# The Dutch system — campaign ledger

Dutch is a **natural 2/1 built around a wide, non-forcing 1♣** — a "lawyer's
Polish Club" that naturalises the Polish 1♣: Polish constructiveness, but
natural and less restricted. It is a **champion candidate**. We copy
[`american()`](../src/bidding/american.rs) and apply the Dutch diff one
measurable phase at a time; Dutch promotes to the shipped default only if it
measures stronger, at which point `american()` demotes to the ablation baseline
(the WBridge5-ships-a-modded-French model).

Read [docs/bidding-architecture.md](bidding-architecture.md) first (the
book/floor/inference layer cake) and [docs/measurement.md](measurement.md) (no
bidding change ships without an A/B).

## Target system

The full bidding spec — openings, the 1♣ response ladder, opener's relay
rebids, and the deep continuation trees — is transcribed from jdh8's Watermelon
Dutch book in **[dutch-spec.md](dutch-spec.md)** (with pons deviations flagged
inline). In one line: a wide non-forcing **1♣** (11–23 catch-all) with a **1♦!
relay** carrying the awkward and the very strong; **1♦** = 5+♦ or the
singleton-club 4441 (never 3♦; every other 4-diamond hand — incl. (xx)45 —
opens 1♣); five-card majors 10–20; a strong artificial **2♣**; and (Phase 3)
Multi / Muiderberg / UNT at the 2-level replacing the weak twos.

## Decisions

1. **Layout = reuse + override.** `dutch()` is a thin factory that reuses
   american's shared module `register()`s (1NT, slam, XYZ, raises, most rebids,
   most competition/defense) and swaps in Dutch modules only for the divergent
   parts. No fork of the ~19k-line tree.
2. **Family = `Family::NATURAL`.** Opponents defend Dutch as natural for now.
3. **2-level openings = lift the shapes, replace weak twos.** Multi/Muiderberg/UNT
   replace american's weak-two 2♦/2♥/2♠ and strong 2NT; strong balanced 20–23
   moves into the wide 1♣. Reuse the existing `woolsey_multi` /
   `woolsey_muiderberg` / `unusual_2nt` shape builders (lifted out of
   1NT-defense gating), re-banded to weak-two strength. (In this codebase
   "Woolsey" is a *defense to their 1NT*, not opening preempts — only the shape
   builders are reused.)

## The central risk — reader/floor are american-tuned

`inference.rs` (the reader) and `instinct.rs` (the floor) are tied to american's
meanings. Two mechanisms:

- **Rule projection** (`set_alert_reading`, default-on) makes every alerted,
  DSL-authored artificial call self-decode by replaying its own `project` fold.
  So Dutch's strong 2♣, Multi 2♦, Muiderberg 2M, UNT 2NT, and the 1♣–1♦ relay
  decode **for free** once authored with projecting combinators + `.alert(...)`.
- The **hardcoded american reading** decodes the natural, unalerted openings.
  Dutch's natural openings differ by range/shape (1♣ 11–23 2+♣; 1♦ 5+/4414; 1M
  10–20), so they get a **soft misread** (biased HCP band), not a phantom-suit
  disaster. Strategy: rely on projection for the artificial calls, accept soft
  natural misreads, **measure the cost**, fix only the worst offenders (Phase 4).

`instinct()` is keyless and only fires off-book, so **completeness of authored
Dutch nodes** (both sides of every convention) is what keeps the floor from
bidding an artificial opening as natural. Dutch keeps american's 15–17 1NT, so
the floor's transfer-completion still holds.

## Phase ledger

| Phase | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Scaffold `dutch()`, re-export, 0.000 baseline | **DONE** |
| 1 | Dutch openings: wide 1♣, 1♦ 5+/4441, 1M 10–20, strong 2♣ | **DONE** (code; A/B pending) |
| 2.1 | Wide-1♣ response table + opener's rebid after the `1♦` relay | **MEASURED — LOSS** (see below); on-plan for a half-built system |
| 2.2 | Deep relay continuations (`1♣-1♦-1M/1NT/2♣/2♦`) + `[1♣,2♣]`/`[1♣,2♦]` continuations | **increments 1–2 AUTHORED** — inc.1 `1♣-1♦-1M` + `1♣-1♦-2♣`; inc.2 opener's rebid over `2♣`/`2♦` **+ responder's continuation** (opener-only cut LOST → responder side authored → **re-A/B WIN `+0.0021/bd plain both`**). Rare relay `1NT`/`2♦!` still deferred |
| 3 | 2-level openings (Multi/Muiderberg/UNT) + strong-2♣ tree | pending |
| 4 | Reader/floor reconciliation + divergent-opening competitive book | pending |
| 5 | Iterate to champion vs BBA/BEN; promote if it wins | pending |

Each phase gates on a paired-seed A/B via `examples/bba-gen` (dutch arm vs
american arm), dual-scored (`ns_score_pd` + `ns_score_contract`), fresh
`SEED_BASE`, run sequentially under `scripts/idle-run.sh`. Preemptive phases
(3) are read knowing DD is blind to obstruction — lean on the sd-lead / PD
bracket, not plain DD alone.

### Phase 2.1 A/B result — LOSS, as expected for a half-built system

`scripts/dutch-ab.sh` (SEED_BASE 1784374548, sha 945c1ae bidding code plus
harness-only `--our-floor dutch` wiring, 204 800 bd/arm/vul vs the BBA
reference opponent). `dutch − american`:

| vul | plain DD IMPs/bd | PD IMPs/bd | fired | IMPs/fired (plain) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | **−0.0278** ±0.0055 | −0.0102 | 6.37% | −0.437 |
| both | **−0.0308** ±0.0074 | −0.0077 | 6.55% | −0.471 |

A clean plain-DD loss (~4σ, not noise) — **not shippable**, and expected: this
is the "half-built convention" bias from [measurement.md](measurement.md), not
a refutation of the wide-1♣ concept. Tracing the worst divergent boards, the
loss splits three ways, all on the roadmap:

1. **Balanced-only 1NT** (`dutch/openings.rs` `hcp(15..=17) & balanced()`) vs
   american's shipped **Wide6322** — 15–17 6322/5422 hands open a *minor* in
   Dutch, `1NT` in american. Recurs as `off: 1NT (X)(XX)` scoring while Dutch's
   minor partscore does not. A Phase-1 lever (flagged below), one-line to flip,
   the cheapest isolation to run next. **FLIPPED 2026-07-18** — Dutch's 1NT now
   reuses american's `notrump_shape(NotrumpShape::Wide6322)`, the A/B-validated
   american default; no fresh gate (the shape carries american's two-seed win).
2. **Half-built competitive continuations** after the wide `1♣` / `1♦` relay —
   contested auctions collapse into doubled Dutch contracts (`5♣X`, `3♠X`,
   `3♦X`) because responder's deeper calls fall to the american-tuned floor/
   reader. This is Phase 2.2 (deep continuations) + Phase 4 (reader) unbuilt.
3. **Strong-opening threshold + slam-continuation gaps** — a 19-count 5–5
   two-suiter opens `1♠` in Dutch but `2♣` in american (cleaner controlled
   auction to game); a slam is missed where american's continuation drives to
   `6♠`. Phase 3 (strong-2♣ tree) + Phase 4.

Nothing here says the wide `1♣` is wrong; it says the system is ~2 phases from
a fair fight. Next diagnostic: isolate factor 1 (Dutch-on-Wide6322 `1NT`) — it
is a within-Dutch A/B, cheap, and sizes how much of the −0.03 is the deliberate
notrump-shape choice vs. the genuinely unbuilt tree.

### Phase 2 notes — the wide-1♣ response structure

Spec tables (responder's calls, opener's relay rebids, the deep continuation
trees) live in **[dutch-spec.md](dutch-spec.md)**. Phase 2.1 authored the first
two nodes — `[1♣]` responses and `[1♣,1♦]` opener rebids; the `2NT!` 5-5-minor
rebid is dropped (unreachable in pons — 5-5 minors open 1♦). This section keeps
only the pons-specific encoding choices and the open items.

Encoding choices (each a small, faithful adaptation — validate in the A/B):

- **Relay constraint = `hcp(5..) | len(♣,..3)`** (constructive values, or too
  short in clubs to pass), sitting at weight 0.3 below every natural and above
  `Pass` (0.0). An OR-disjunction projects to the WALL → floors nothing → the
  alert cleanly suppresses the natural-diamond reading with no phantom suit.
- **Weak jump = exactly six, preempt = seven-plus** (`2M` `6..=6`, `3M` `7..`)
  so `2♥♠` and `3♥♠` partition by length rather than overlapping on 6+.
- **`2NT`/`3NT` deduped at 11** — `2NT` 10–11 invite keeps the 11, `3NT`
  encoded 12–15 to-play (doc lists 3NT as 11–15).
- **Opener's `2♣` spans 11–20**, not 11–17, so an 18–20 unbalanced no-4M no-6♣
  five-club hand has a rebid instead of falling to the `Pass` catch-all; opener
  resolves the exact band on the next round (Phase 2.2).
- **1M responses use up-the-line** (bid the cheaper 4-card major first), pure
  DSL, no dependency on american's `spades_first`/`hearts_first`. Longer-major
  discipline (reader-preferred) is a deferred refinement.

Alerts: only the genuinely artificial calls trip the invariant — `1♦!` relay,
opener's `2♦!`/`2NT!`. The natural-but-meaning-inverted calls (`2♦` GF, `2♣`
INV+, weak jumps, minor invites, major preempts) are *also* alerted so
projection self-decodes them (american's hardcoded reader would otherwise read
`2♦` as a weak jump and `2♣` as an inverted raise). Balanced/notrump naturals
(`1M`, `1NT`, `2NT`, `3NT`) are left unalerted — american's read is close enough.

### Phase 2.2 increment 1 — responder's second call over opener's minimum

Authored `1♣-1♦-1M` (both majors) and `1♣-1♦-2♣` — where the bulk of relay
auctions land (opener minimum, 11–17). The rare 18–20 `1NT` and 21–23 `2♦!`
continuations are **deferred**: opener's strength there self-discloses to the
floor through rule projection (the calls are alerted), so the floor bids toward
the right game without an authored node — a refinement, not a hole. Measure the
common case first, then decide.

Encoding choices (jdh8-confirmed bridge, 2026-07-19):

- **Reverse Flannery** (`2M!`, and `2♥!` over opener's `2♣`) is gated **exactly**
  on `5=♠ & 4–5♥ & 7–9` — the two-suiter deliberately routed through the relay to
  dodge the `1♣-1♠-2♣` rebid squeeze (and to keep a direct `1♣-1♠-2♣-2♥` INV+).
  An ordinary invitational major-raiser never arrives (it raised/bid on round
  one), so no natural-raise row exists; such hands fall to the floor.
- **`2OM!` = both minors** (5+/4+, 9–11 invite). A natural major is impossible
  here (real four-card majors bid up the line on round one), and if a Reverse
  Flannery fit mattered it was already found — so the "other major" is free to
  repurpose. Encoded 4-4 minors with at least one five-bagger.
- **Club support inverted** over `2♣`: the artificial `2♠!` is the *invitational*
  raise (9–11), the natural `3♣` the *minimum* one (7–9).
- **`2NT` = 16+ balanced** is alerted (a meaning inversion vs american's invite)
  so projection discloses the slam-going strength and rightsides the notrump.

**Open questions / deferrals:**

- **✓ Phase-1 spec discrepancy resolved (2026-07-18):** the online `1D.md`
  argument for opening 1♦ on (xx)45 [4♦5♣] is **stale** — jdh8 is no longer
  following it. In pons, **(xx)45 opens 1♣** (the locked `1♦ = 5+♦ | 4441`
  stands) for simplicity and as an experiment. Consequence: the `2NT!` 5-5-minor
  rebid is unreachable (5-5 minors open 1♦) and was **dropped**.
- **Deep continuations — increment 1 authored (2026-07-19):** `1♣-1♦-1M` and
  `1♣-1♦-2♣` (see the increment-1 section above). Still deferred: `1♣-1♦-1NT`
  (18–20 transfer structure, reuses the 1NT machinery) and `1♣-1♦-2♦` (21–23
  transfer structure) — rare, and their strength self-discloses to the floor via
  projection. Opener's third call (after responder's authored second call) still
  falls to the floor — a soft misread, measured not fixed blind.
- **✓ `[1♣,2♣]` / `[1♣,2♦]` overwritten + responder side (increment 2,
  2026-07-19)** — see the increment-2 section below. The opener-only first cut
  left responder to the floor and **measured a loss** (git-arms A/B: the floor
  dropped the game force and blasted slam blind, `−0.0029/bd plain, −1.38
  IMPs/fired`); the **responder side authored** (honour the force, cap at the
  right game) turned it into a **win** — re-A/B `+0.0012/bd plain none,
  +0.0021/bd plain both, PD positive throughout, +0.53…+0.86 IMPs/fired` (the
  responder side alone worth `+1.97…+3.20 IMPs/fired`). Slam beyond game deferred
  to a later RKCB reuse.

### Phase 2.2 increment 2 — opener's rebid after responder's natural 2♣ / 2♦

Overwrites the two continuations american built for its own (different) meanings:
american routes `1♣-2♣` to an **inverted club raise** (forcing) and `1♣-2♦` to a
**weak jump shift** (0–6). Under Dutch, `2♣` is invite+ (5+♣) and `2♦` is
game-forcing (5+♦), so both american nodes misread responder — the GF is treated
as weak (drops games/slams), the invite as forcing (opener can't stop). Authored
`opener_rebids_after_two_diamonds` / `opener_rebids_after_two_clubs`
(`dutch/responses.rs`).

Structure (jdh8-confirmed bridge, 2026-07-19). **Key fact:** after 1♣ (denies a
5-card major — those open 1M) and responder's `2♣`/`2♦` (deny a 4-card major), **no
major fit can exist**, so both auctions are the pure inverted-minors world
(minor-fit / notrump / slam). Opener borrows american's `after_inv_raise` ladder:

- **`2♦` (GF), forcing:** `3♦` = 4-card diamond support (a known nine-card fit —
  and the wide 1♣ hosts most 4-diamond hands, the Dutch enrichment); `3♣` = a real
  5+ club second suit; `3NT` = balanced extras, both majors stopped; `2♥`/`2♠` = a
  single major stopper up the line toward 3NT (`!stopper` in the other, so a
  both-stopped hand takes notrump); `2NT` = the notrump catch-all. No Pass.
- **`2♣` (invite+), non-forcing:** `3NT` = accept (balanced max stopped, or a 17+
  maximum forcing over the 11+ invite = 28+); `3♣` = decline with club support
  (capped ≤16 so a maximum never leaves it in); `2NT` = the balanced-minimum
  decline / catch-all. The help-suit game try (`2♥`/`2♠`) is **dropped** — the
  artificial try needs its own authored responder read; a cheap accept/decline
  lands the same games.

**Responder's continuation: authored (the redo).** The first cut left responder to
the floor on a shallow probe ("drives GF hands to 3NT, passes a dead minimum")
and **it measured a loss.** A git-arms A/B (dutch@inc.2 vs dutch@inc.1, 204 800
bd/arm, SEED_BASE 1784400427) scored `−0.0029/bd plain, −0.0027/bd PD, −1.38
IMPs/fired` (0.21% fired), and the worst boards diagnosed why: the floor **dropped
the game force** — passing opener's forcing `3♣` over `2♦` (`1♣-2♦-3♣` passed out,
a making 6NT missed) — and **blasted slam blind** over opener's `3NT`/stopper-shows
(`2♦-2♠-6NT`, `2♣-3NT-4NT-5♥X`). The probe was too shallow: it checked opener's
placement, not responder's read of the artificial rebids. Lesson re-paid: never
ship on analysis alone; complete both sides before measuring.

`responder_after_two_diamonds` / `responder_after_two_clubs` now author the
responder side to honour the force and cap at the right game:

- **After `2♦` (GF):** `3NT` on every descriptive rebid (`3♦`/`3♣`/`2♥`/`2♠`/`2NT`
  → name the game, never pass the force); Pass over opener's own `3NT` (15+
  balanced, to play).
- **After `2♣` (invite+):** Pass the `3NT` accept; over a non-forcing decline
  (`3♣`/`2NT`) drive `3NT` with the game-forcing end (12+), else pass the invite.

**Re-A/B: the fix wins.** Rebuilt git-arms (SEED_BASE 1784402356, 204 800
bd/arm/vul), complete inc.2 (opener+responder) vs pre-inc.2: `+0.0012/bd plain,
+0.0007/bd PD` (none); `+0.0021/bd plain, +0.0015/bd PD` (both); `+0.53…+0.86
IMPs/fired`, 0.23% fired — a **plain-DD win, both vuls** (3 of 4 CIs exclude
zero), flipping the opener-only loss. Isolating the responder side (head2 vs the
opener-only head1) it is worth `+1.97…+3.20 IMPs/fired` on its own — the exact
mechanism the worst-board trace predicted. (This run also fixed a harness bug in
the *first* A/B, whose `-v both` was dropped, so none/both scored identically;
the redo's vul split is real.)

Slam beyond game is **deferred**: the A/B's dominant loss was blind slam *blasts*,
not missed keycard slams, so the disciplined first cut lands the game cleanly. The
`3♦` diamond-fit branch is the home for a later RKCB reuse (widening
`american::slam::install_rkcb` past `pub(super)`), pending a re-A/B that shows the
game cap leaking slams. Everything responder bids here is natural (notrump / pass,
projecting no suit), so no alert is carried and `dutch_artificial_calls_are_alerted`
passes untouched. The `responder_continues_after_opener_rebid` test locks in the
fix.

### Phase 1 notes

`bare_dutch()` takes a full `bare_american()` pair and **overwrites only the
opening node** (`Trie::insert_arc` replaces the classifier at the opening key)
with `dutch::openings::dutch_openings()`; every american continuation is reused
verbatim. Widening was minimal: `insert_uncontested` and `with_instinct_floor`
in `american.rs` → `pub(in crate::bidding)`. Openings live in
`src/bidding/dutch/openings.rs`.

Design choices to validate in the A/B (each defensible from the spec, cheap to
flip):

- **Rule of 20 is a hard gate** (`hcp(band) & rule_of_20()`), so a flat
  sub-R20 minimum passes out — e.g. a 4-3-3-3 twelve-count (12+4+3 = 19).
- **1NT is american's Wide6322 15–17** (balanced, or a 5422/6322 with a long
  minor) — flipped from the Phase-1 balanced-only choice on 2026-07-18, reusing
  american's `notrump_shape(NotrumpShape::Wide6322)`. The shape is already
  A/B-validated on american (two-seed win, +0.004…0.006 IMPs/bd plain,
  sd-confirmed), so Dutch inherits that evidence by reusing the identical gate;
  this also closes factor 1 of the Phase 2.1 LOSS post-mortem.
- **No 3rd/4th-seat light (9-count) major openers** — american has them; the
  Dutch spec caps majors at a Rule-of-20 10-count. Watch the passed-out-seat
  boards.
- **Strong balanced 20–21 still opens 2NT** (Phase 1 placeholder); only 22–23
  balanced reaches the wide 1♣ until Phase 3 turns 2NT into UNT.

Guards: `dutch_artificial_calls_are_alerted` (inference.rs) walks the Dutch
constructive book; `dutch::tests::opening_partition` pins the six load-bearing
opening cases (incl. the wide 1♣ hosting a 23-count). `dutch()` is re-exported
as `pons::dutch`.

### Phase 0 notes

Scaffolded `dutch()` as a sibling factory (re-exported `pons::dutch`). The
reuse + override seam opened in Phase 1; widening american internals is done
only as each part diverges.
