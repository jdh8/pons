## [0.10.0] — Unreleased

### Changed

- **Over a `(2♣)` overcall of our `1NT` we now play *systems on*, not Lebensohl.**
  A 2♣ overcall steals no room — every transfer and relay still sits above it — so
  imposing the Lebensohl relay/transfer-through structure was wrong (and bred a
  losing "natural 2♦" escape that has no opener game-raise). Responder now keeps
  the **uncontested** 1NT structure: Jacoby transfers (`2♦`→♥, `2♥`→♠), the minor
  transfers, the 2NT/3-level responses — and shows the now-unbiddable **2♣ Stayman
  with a Double** (X inherits the 2♣ rule's exact logit, so it never drifts). The
  book reuses `notrump_responses()` by rebasing `1NT–(2♣)–…` onto the uncontested
  tree (the 2♣ overcall maps to the opponent's pass; a Double maps to the stolen
  2♣). Lebensohl proper now applies only over `(2♦/2♥/2♠)`, the overcalls that
  actually take away room.
- **Responder's weak natural `2♦/2♥/2♠` escape is now floored at 6 HCP, and opener
  game-raises it** — the relay sign-off's treatment (`lebensohl_relay_shape` +
  `lebensohl_signoff_raise`) extended to the one-level-lower direct escape, since
  they are the same weak 5-card-suit hand. A/B (floored vs unfloored, 300k
  unfiltered, perfect-defense): **+0.012/+0.016 IMPs/board (none/both)**, every
  mechanism positive — the floor sends sub-6 hands to defend (`resp P`, the largest
  share), opener stops overbidding a known-weak signoff (`late P`), and a maximum
  with a fit reaches game (`4♥/4♠`). Lowering the floor to 5 HCP or to 6 total
  points was a measured wash (+0.001, the majors gaining roughly what the
  raise-less minor loses), so 6 HCP — matching the relay — ships. Gated behind
  `set_natural_floor(hcp_floor, points_floor)` for further A/B.

### Added

- **`lebensohl-ab --diverge-diff`: per-call attribution of the A/B swing.** Buckets
  every divergent board by the measured (`--ns`) pair's *first* call the baseline
  (`--ew`) would not have made — tagged `resp` (responder's action directly over
  `1NT–(2X)`) or `late` (e.g. opener completing a transfer) — and reports
  boards/IMPs/contribution per call (the `contrib` column sums to the headline
  IMPs/board). Isolates which call drives the result. Finding (transfer vs the
  bare floor, 200k unfiltered, none-vul, perfect-defense): the penalty double is
  the single worst call (−5.05 IMPs/board × 201 boards, −0.005/board), the weak
  natural 2-level escapes also lose, and the `2NT` relay + `3♦`/`3♥` transfers are
  the positive drivers — i.e. the competitive outlets, not the constructive ones,
  carry the PD loss against the floor.
- **`lebensohl-ab --pd-natural`: PD-gate + distill for the weak natural escape.**
  Mirrors `--pd-relay` for responder's natural `2♦/2♥/2♠` over the overcall
  (double-dummy compare bidding vs defending; `--log-relay` emits `NATURAL` lines).
  Distill (12k filtered boards, 64 layouts, perfect-defense): unlike the `2NT`
  relay, the weak natural has **no rescuing floor** — bidding loses to defending at
  *every* HCP 0–8 (mean EV margin −34 to −119 score points, never positive) and at
  every suit length (6-card −34, 5-card −53). The least-bad slice is a 6+ length
  gate, but even that stays PD-negative — there is no HCP crossover to distill.
  Per the standing DD-blind-to-obstruction caveat, this is **not** taken as a
  signal to floor or drop the escape (its obstructive value is invisible to
  perfect defense); deferred to a single-dummy measure.
- **Plain Lebensohl gains a direct cue-bid (Stayman) and good-5 sign-offs, to
  compete on even terms with Transfer Lebensohl.** After `1NT` is overcalled and
  `LebensohlStyle::Plain` is selected, responder's cue of the opponents' suit is
  now game-forcing Stayman with a 4-card unbid major and no 5-card suit of its
  own (the cue outranks a direct `3NT`, so a 4-4 major fit is found even with a
  stopper); opener answers it via the existing cue-Stayman machinery. Previously
  such hands could only bid `3NT`, never finding the major fit. The weak `2NT`
  relay now also admits a 5-card suit below the overcall — relay then correct
  `3♣`→`3M` as a 3-level sign-off — instead of requiring 6+, **gated by a 6+ HCP
  floor**; and a stack in *their* suit no longer wrongly relays (it is a penalty
  pass). The 5-card relay, the HCP floor, and the their-suit exclusion apply to
  **both** Plain and Transfer Lebensohl; the new cue is Plain-only (Transfer
  already cues). The 6-HCP floor is **PD-distilled**: a perfect-defense gate
  (`lebensohl-ab --pd-relay`, double-dummy comparing relay vs defend per board)
  beats blanket all-5-card relaying by +0.023 to +0.032 IMPs/board, and a plain
  `hcp(6..)` floor — adverse-suit values were *not* predictive; overall weakness
  is the driver — recovers ~60–80% of that gain with zero runtime cost (pushing a
  near-bust to the 3 level loses on DD even with a 6-card suit). A/B steps
  (lebensohl-ab, vs floor): any-5 beats good-5 (two top-three honors) by +0.010
  to +0.022, then the HCP floor adds the PD gain on top. *(Note: advancing a
  takeout double reuses the Plain responder table, so the advancer can now bid the
  cue, but the doubler's reply there is still floored — the point/shape re-tuning
  for the lighter, shapier double is deferred to a future session.)*

- **A maximum 1NT opener can now stretch a weak Lebensohl sign-off to game.**
  After responder relays `2NT` weakly and corrects `3♣`→`3M` (a 6–9 sign-off in
  a major, the floor above), a *maximum* opener (17, in the 15–17 range) holding
  three-card support raises to game instead of passing — the relay's 6-HCP floor
  makes the combined count high enough to reach `4M` on a long-trump dummy.
  Applies to both Lebensohl styles, majors only (a minor's game is the 5 level,
  out of reach for a 6–9 hand). A/B (lebensohl-ab, 500k unfiltered, vs floor):
  +0.0010 to +0.0012 IMPs/board across plain/transfer × non-vul/vul — a rare node
  (the sign-off-to-major sequence only arises over a `2♠` overcall) but positive
  in every cell and never negative. *(Re-confirmed that the relay floor belongs in
  raw HCP, not points: a perfect-defense crossover analysis shows the
  relay-vs-defend boundary is sharp at 6 HCP — 21%→80% — but mushy on the
  shape-upgraded points scale, because the upgrade drags light, shapely
  defend-hands into the relay bucket. The driver is defensive values, not playing
  strength.)*

- **Transfer Lebensohl now *recognizes* a partner's delayed cue, and can
  optionally bid it (ledger #106).** Larry Cohen's stopper-split cue: a *delayed*
  cue (relay through `2NT`, then the opponents' suit) is Stayman *with* a stopper
  in their suit and exactly a 4-card unbid major (denying 5 — Smolen / Leaping
  Michaels keep those), versus the plain *direct* cue. Two layers, split so the
  shipped system is byte-identical in self-play:
  - **Recognition is on by default.** Over `(2♥)`/`(2♠)`, in both the `1NT`-overcalled
    and the `(2X)–X–(P)` advance contexts, the bot now answers a delayed cue (show
    the other major at game with a fit, else `3NT` — partner's stopper makes it
    safe), so a human partner who plays the convention gets a sensible reply. The
    bot never *bids* the delayed cue itself, so this node is dormant in bot-vs-bot
    play and changes no measurement; it only activates opposite a partner who bids it.
  - **Bidding it is opt-in**, behind the new
    [`set_delayed_cue`][pons::bidding::american::set_delayed_cue] toggle (default
    `false`); `--delayed-cue` on the `sohl-after-double-ab` example. When on, the
    bot also routes its stopper hands through the delayed cue and reads its own
    direct cue as denying a stopper (running no-stopper, no-fit hands to a minor
    game over a stopperless `3NT`). Isolation A/B (delayed-cue-`Transfer` vs
    plain-`Transfer`, perfect-defense, 200k filtered boards/cell): **+0.000 / +0.001
    IMPs/board (none/both)** on ~0.4 % divergence — **dead flat, so it stays
    opt-in, not default.** Stopper hands reach the same contract fast or slow, and
    the real value of showing a stopper (concealment, right-siding the notrump) is
    single-dummy, which the double-dummy / perfect-defense measure looks through —
    the same wall that sank the reverted `TransferSmolen` and the removed `Rubensohl`.

- **Transfer Lebensohl now plays a richer structure over a `(2♦)` overcall of our
  `1NT` (ledger #80); behavior over `(2♥)`/`(2♠)`/`(2♣)` is unchanged.** When an
  opponent overcalls our `1NT` with `2♦`, responder now plays more than bare Cohen:
  `3♣` is game-forcing Stayman with a Smolen continuation
  (`1NT–(2♦)–3♣–P–3♦–P–3♥/3♠` shows 5-4 majors), the 3-level transfers shift down to
  direct Jacoby (`3♦`→♥, `3♥`→♠, `3♠`→♣ — the club leg a *forced* game-force, since
  its `4♣` completion leaves `3♣` unplayable), and `4♦`/`4♣` are Leaping Michaels
  (both majors 5-5 / clubs + a 5+ major). Over a `2♥`/`2♠`/`2♣` overcall it is
  byte-identical to bare Cohen. This `(2♦)` package is part of the default
  [`LebensohlStyle::Transfer`][pons::bidding::american::LebensohlStyle]
  ([`set_lebensohl_style`][pons::bidding::american::set_lebensohl_style]); `Plain`
  remains opt-in. A/B of the package vs bare Cohen-over-`(2♦)`
  (`examples/lebensohl-ab`, perfect-defense `ns_score`, 200k filtered boards/cell):
  **+0.020/+0.024 IMPs/board, +2.286/+2.822 IMPs/divergent (none/both)** — a clean
  win that reverses an earlier, reverted standard-Stayman+Smolen hybrid
  (−1.31/−1.76/div). The gain is genuine fit-finding the double-dummy / perfect-defense
  measure can credit (5-3 major games through Stayman+Smolen, 5-5 major games through
  Leaping Michaels), not the DD-blind right-siding that sank the earlier attempt.
- **Transfer Lebensohl's top step is now a forcing transfer to clubs (ledger #80).**
  Cohen's transfers run *up the line through* the adverse suit, so the highest 3-level
  step has no suit above it and wraps back to clubs: `1NT–(2♦/2♥)–3♠` and `1NT–(2♠)–3♥`
  are now a *forced* game-force transfer to clubs (6+♣, game values, no stopper in
  their suit; opener completes `3NT` with a stopper, else `5♣`). These previously fell
  to the natural instinct floor, leaving a 6+♣ game-forcing hand with no call — the
  weak `2NT`→`3♣` relay is limited to ≤8 points and can't carry a game force. Applies
  to `Transfer` over every overcall, and to the `(2♦)` Smolen leg's own `3♠`→♣
  transfer. Perfect-defense A/B
  (two binaries at a fixed `--seed`, `transfer` vs the bare floor, 200k
  filtered/cell): **−0.0008/−0.0012 IMPs/board (none/both)** — a tiny, consistent loss
  confined to ≈0.04% of boards. Those boards are normal making games (`3NT`/`5♣`) that
  double-dummy scores below the floor's *speculative penalty doubles of the overcall*
  under perfect defense — the harness's known blindness to competition/obstruction
  (cf. Lebensohl-vs-floor #80), not a transfer misjudgment. Kept in the default as a
  theory-correct completion, pending a single-dummy re-measure. `examples/lebensohl-ab`
  gains `--seed` (deterministic two-binary runs) and `--only-topstep` (restrict to
  top-step boards).
- **Responsive double re-measured under perfect defense (ledger #100); two opt-in
  toggles, defaults unchanged.** The shipped responsive double after partner's
  *takeout* double and their raise (`(1t)–X–(2t)–X` — the canonical convention, and
  BBA's single `Responsive double` toggle, on in `21GF.bbsa`) is now gated by
  [`set_responsive_takeout`][pons::bidding::american::set_responsive_takeout]
  (default **on**), and a non-standard *overcall* extension (`(1t)–overcall–(2t)–X`,
  nearest to BBA's `Snapdragon Double`, off in 21GF) by
  [`set_responsive_overcall`][pons::bidding::american::set_responsive_overcall]
  (default **off**). The new `examples/responsive-ab` A/B (200k filtered/cell,
  perfect-defense `ns_score`) measures both against the bare instinct floor: takeout
  **−1.18/−1.89 IMPs/divergent** (−0.0003/−0.0006 per raw deal, none/both),
  overcall-ext **−2.16/−3.53** (−0.0020/−0.0032 per raw deal). Both stay as they
  were — the overcall extension remains rejected (the new scoring does not rescue the
  reverted −0.034/−2.37 result; it is slightly *worse* vulnerable, as perfect defense
  punishes the doubled-down overbids), and the takeout part stays shipped: its per-deal
  drag is negligible and its competitive/obstruction value is invisible to the
  double-dummy measure (the same reason `Lebensohl`-vs-floor was kept despite flipping
  negative under perfect defense). **The `american()` default is byte-identical to
  before** (takeout on, overcall off).

- **The advancer after a takeout double of a weak `(2♦)` now plays Transfer's `(2♦)`
  Smolen package (ledger #80).** After `(2♦)–X–(P)`, the default
  [`set_advance_sohl_style(LebensohlStyle::Transfer)`][pons::bidding::american::set_advance_sohl_style]
  advance now answers with `3♣`-Stayman + Smolen, direct Jacoby transfers, and Leaping
  Michaels `4♣`/`4♦` — the same package the 1NT context plays — instead of bare Cohen
  transfers-through; `(2♥)`/`(2♠)` advances are unchanged. It reuses the Section-5d
  builders verbatim under the `(2X)–X–(P)` prefix. Head-to-head vs the prior
  plain-Cohen advance (`examples/sohl-after-double-ab`, perfect-defense `ns_score`,
  200k filtered/cell): **+0.014/+0.019 IMPs/board, +1.77/+2.52 IMPs/divergent
  (none/both)** — a clean win whose per-divergent edge *rises* with vulnerability, the
  signature of reaching better contracts (which the measure credits) rather than
  right-siding (which it cannot see). With the package now winning in **both**
  contexts, the experimental `TransferSmolen` style is folded into `Transfer` (it
  never shipped as a separate variant): `Transfer` *is* Cohen-plus-Smolen-over-`(2♦)`,
  so the styles are again `Off`/`Plain`/`Transfer`.
- **Search at every authored leaf (AI-bidder M7.0) — `american_search_book`.**
  A new gated bidder, [`SearchBook`][pons::bidding::search_floor::SearchBook] /
  [`american_search_book`], that prices **authored book leaves by double-dummy
  cardplay**, not only the off-book auctions. Today
  [`american_search`][pons::american_search] runs the live search only where the
  book is silent (the contested fallback floor); `SearchBook` widens it to every
  *non-forced* book leaf: the leaf's authored logits become the search *prior*
  (rather than the final word), and DD re-judges among the calls the rule proposes
  **∪ the net's top-`k` natural alternatives** — so it can override an inflexible
  one-call rule — over sampled layouts, then bids the highest-EV call. "Rules
  propose, DD disposes," at every leaf. The authored *constraints* (meaning) are
  untouched — an opening still forbids `Pass` — only the authored *weights*
  (judgement) are overridden by the specific cards. The EV-pricing core
  (`price_and_blend`) is shared with `SearchFloor` (extracted byte-identically), and
  every §0 safety invariant is inherited verbatim: a forced auction delegates to the
  deterministic stance before any search, legality masking is unchanged, and the
  rollout RNG is seeded from the decision (determinism). It wraps a *bound* `Stance`
  (build it with `american_search_book(them)`); [`american`] and `instinct()` are
  untouched and stay the default. This is the **treatment arm** of the M7 A/B
  against `american_search` (DD off-book only) — on a measured win it folds into
  `american_search` as a default-on knob rather than living on as a twin. Strong but
  *very* slow (it searches every non-forced on-book decision); gated behind the
  `search` feature, with [`examples/search-book`](examples/search-book/main.rs) as
  the IMPs/board A/B harness. **Measured (120 boards, vul none, seed 1,
  perfect-defense scoring): wrapping *every* leaf as-is REGRESSES** — −2.958
  IMPs/board vs `american` (95% CI [−4.605, −1.312], excludes 0 — a clear loss) and
  −1.700 vs `american_search` ([−3.552, +0.152], point estimate firmly negative). The
  losses concentrate in *competitive* auctions where the convention is undecoded:
  the layout sampler then deals partner ranges too wide, so double-dummy over-values
  doubled grands (the divergent dump shows leaf-pricing reaching failing `7♣xx`). The
  fix is the M7.1 `Inferences::read` decode sweep (skip the search on any leaf with no
  usable decode); until then this is a recorded negative result, not a default. No
  effect on `american()`/`instinct()` (untouched, still the default and baseline).
- **Constraint extraction from the trained net — sample-and-probe (new example):**
  added [`examples/extract-constraints`](examples/extract-constraints/main.rs),
  which recovers human-readable *candidate* bidding constraints for **any
  auction, including competitive ones**. For a fixed auction prefix (`--auction
  "1♦ 1♠"`) it deals random actor hands — filtered to the actor's own shown
  shape — runs the real distilled bidder (`american_neural_search` by default, or
  `--net v2`/`neural`; legality mask and forced rails included), buckets each hand
  by the call it produces, and summarises every bucket in the DSL's own vocabulary:
  a chosen-share %, an HCP range, per-suit length bands, balanced %, and a
  copy-pasteable `sketch:` line such as `hcp(15..=18) & balanced()` (1NT) or, after
  `1♦ (1♠)`, `hcp(2..=9) & len(Diamonds, 5..)` (the preemptive `3♦` raise) versus
  `hcp(9..=18) & len(Diamonds, 5..)` (the `2♠` cue-raise). This replaces an earlier
  weight-linearization + data-dump approach that ignored the ReLU and matched a
  fixed corpus by exact context — brittle exactly where it mattered, contested
  auctions. The net's output depends only on `(actor hand, auction)`, so probing
  it directly is both simpler and faithful. Output is verifier-ready hypotheses,
  not proof: check a `sketch` with [`bidding::verify`] before authoring a rule.
  Builds under the `search` feature.
- **Leaping Michaels over a weak two — now on by default.** Over an opponent's
  weak two, a jump to `4♣`/`4♦` names a 5-5 two-suiter with game-forcing values:
  over a major it shows a minor + the *other* major; over `2♦` the `4♦` cue shows
  both majors and `4♣` shows clubs + a major. Advancer continuations are authored
  too — a fit major game (taking even a 7-card fit, which scores well and needs
  only ten tricks), else the `5m` minor game, never a passed-out partscore; over
  `2♦`, `4♥` is pass-or-correct to opener's major. *Measure* (`leaping-michaels-ab`
  contested seat-swap A/B, 40 000 filtered boards): **+1.090 / +1.452 IMPs/board
  (none / both) vs the prior weak-two defense** — a clear win, so it ships **on**;
  [`set_leaping_michaels`]`(false)` recovers the old behavior. (An earlier cut that
  left the advance to the instinct floor measured *negative*: the floor passed the
  two-suiter, stranding us in `4m` or the opponents' suit; authoring the advance
  flipped the sign.) The inference reader
  ([`Inferences::read`][pons::bidding::inference]) also decodes the overcall's
  two-suiter, so the live double-dummy search bidder (`american_search`,
  `--features search`) chooses the advance by cardplay EV — adding **+2.8
  IMPs/board over the authored rules** in a directional A/B and reaching the slams
  (`6♥`, `7♣`) the game-capped rules cannot. See the ledger (toggle 79).
- **Transfer Lebensohl — now the default over our overcalled 1NT** (Larry Cohen's
  version). A first attempt at transfer-Lebensohl lost (−1.7 IMPs/divergent — see
  the plain-Lebensohl entry below) by stranding game hands in partscores; Cohen's
  structure fixes exactly that. (Naming: this keeps the weak `2NT` *relay*, which
  makes it Transfer Lebensohl; *Rubensohl* proper makes `2NT` an artificial club
  transfer — tried on this structure and **not adopted**: the `2NT`-role swap
  measured −0.017 / −0.046 IMPs/board (none / both, 200k each), because
  right-siding the low-suit partscore is double-dummy-blind while two-way low
  transfers cost the auto-drive-to-game; see the ledger.) After `1NT–(2X)`,
  responder's three-level bids are **transfers up the line, *through* the adverse
  suit** (over `(2♥)`, `3♦` shows spades — skipping their hearts), the **cue is
  Stayman**, and a transfer to a suit *above* theirs is invitational-or-better, so
  **opener is driven to game** (`4M` with a fit, else `3NT`) — never a three-level
  partscore. Weak hands keep the plain outlets (natural two-level, `2NT` relay to
  `3♣`, penalty double). Selected by a new [`LebensohlStyle`]
  (`Off`/`Plain`/`Transfer`) via [`set_lebensohl_style`]; [`set_lebensohl`]`(bool)`
  stays as a `Plain`/`Off` shim. *Why it matters:* right-siding the strong `1NT`
  hand as declarer and describing shape more precisely under interference reaches
  better contracts. *Measure* (`lebensohl-ab` contested seat-swap A/B, 200 000
  boards per cell): **+0.46 / +1.24 IMPs/divergent (none / both) vs plain
  Lebensohl** (the incumbent default; 1 637 / 1 781 divergent, ~0.8–0.9 % of
  boards; +0.004 / +0.011 IMPs/board), and **+0.35 / +0.05 vs the bare floor** — so
  the earlier −1.7 loss is gone, now a gain. The double-dummy measure is blind to
  the right-siding effect, so the real table value is higher still. Tracked in
  [`docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md`](docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md).
- **Lebensohl after a takeout double (advancer over a weak two) — measured,
  opt-in.** Plain / Transfer / Pam (pick-a-minor) / Lawrence (three-band
  strength) sohl structures were authored over the `(2X)–X–(P)` advancer
  prefix and A/B'd against the `advance_double` floor on `sohl-after-double-ab`
  (contested seat-swap, 200k filtered boards/cell). At best DD-neutral vs the
  floor (a takeout double already advertises the fit, so natural advancing
  finds most of it). `Transfer` (the best) is kept behind
  [`set_advance_sohl_style`] as an opt-in (**default `Off`** — the floor);
  `Plain` is the A/B arm, while `Pam` / `Lawrence` were rejected and not
  retained. Tracked in
  [`docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md`](docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md).
- **Plain-4NT minor-suit keycard** (Roman Keycard Blackwood 1430 for an agreed
  minor — Batch 2 of the "author 2/1 as deep as BBA" effort). [`install_rkcb`] was
  major-only, so a minor fit carrying slam values could not ask for keycards at
  all: the strong-`2♣` minor raise blind-jumped to `6m`/`5m` on raw HCP, and
  inverted minor raises topped out at `3NT`. The ask now works for clubs and
  diamonds with the same `5♣/5♦/5♥/5♠` answers and a *cramped-signoff* asker — it
  signs off in 5-of-the-minor when that call is still legal (diamonds over a `5♣`
  answer), passes when partner's answer *is* 5-of-the-minor, and otherwise has no
  room and bids the small slam. Wired into the two cleanest minor-agreement
  auctions: the **strong-`2♣` minor raise** (`2♣–2♦–3m–4m`, opener launches `4NT`
  with 28+) and the **inverted minor raise** (`1m–2m–3NT`, responder launches
  `4NT` with slam values over opener's 18–19). *Why it matters:* a cold minor slam
  the floor could never bid is a ~12-IMP swing. *Measure* (`stayman-abc`
  constructive A/B, new vs the pre-change floor, 2 000 000 boards):
  **+6.80/+8.76 IMPs/divergent (none/both)** over 46 divergent boards (~1 in
  43 000 — minor-slam auctions are rare; +0.0002 IMPs/board). *Scope:* plain 4NT
  only — the 5NT king ask is **major-only** (over a minor, 5NT misreads as the ask
  and the `6♣/6♦` king answers collide with the trump slam), so grand slams in a
  minor stay under-bid; Kickback, the usual remedy, is out of scope. Tracked in
  [`docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md`](docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md).
- **Lebensohl after our 1NT is overcalled** (toward BBA's 21GF depth — first
  competitive convention of the "author 2/1 as deep as BBA" effort). When we open
  `1NT` and an opponent overcalls at the two level, responder previously fell to
  the natural [`instinct()`] floor. A new competitive-book section gives plain
  Lebensohl: a weak hand relays through `2NT` to a forced `3♣` (sign off in clubs
  or correct to a six-card suit), while a game hand bids a **forcing** three-level
  suit or a to-play `3NT` directly — so a game is never stranded in a partscore.
  Penalty doubles and weak natural two-level bids round out the table.
  *Why it matters:* the floor competes naturally but cannot relay a weak hand to
  the right partscore or force game cleanly under interference. *Measure*
  (contested seat-swap A/B, Lebensohl vs the floor, opponents overcall,
  `lebensohl-ab` 200 000 boards vul none): **+0.26 IMPs/divergent** (1 764
  divergent, ~0.9 % of boards; +0.002 IMPs/board — a small, correct gain
  concentrated in the rare overcalled-1NT auctions). A first attempt at
  *Rubensohl* (transfer-Lebensohl) measured a **net loss** (−1.7 IMPs/divergent):
  its transfers stranded game hands in partscores because the rebid re-evaluated
  too conservatively, and it shadowed the floor's penalty doubles — recorded in
  [`docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md`](docs/ai-bidder/21gf-ledger.md). Plain
  Lebensohl is now the [`LebensohlStyle::Plain`] option; the corrected Transfer
  Lebensohl (see above) is the default. The ledger tracks pons's 2/1 against the
  `21GF.bbsa` convention card.
- **A deeper deterministic floor — Milestone 6.1: parametric auction
  inferences.** The keyless [`instinct()`] floor now *derives* responder's
  major-suit length from a completed Jacoby transfer rather than going silent on
  it ([`Inferences`]): `1NT–2♦–2♥` shows five-plus hearts, and a follow-up jump to
  game (`…–4♥`, the canonical case) or raise of the suit (`…–3♥`, which also pins
  invitational strength) shows **six** — responder bypassed the choice-of-games
  `3NT`. A new six-two arm in the floor's `known_major_fit` lets opener act on
  that shown six-card suit opposite a doubleton — the fit the prior bidder could
  not see after a transfer (`known_major_fit` needed three-card support on one
  side). Both majors, over 1NT and 2NT; uncontested only. *Why it matters:* the
  floor can now accept a transfer invitation with a maximum (`1NT–2♦–2♥–3♥` →
  `4♥` on a six-two fit) instead of always passing, and the sampler behind the
  search floor deals layouts consistent with the shown six-card suit. *Measure*
  (seeded constructive A/B, baseline vs M6.1 `american()`, opponents silenced,
  200 000 boards): **+1.94 IMPs/divergent vul none, +2.25 vul both** (306
  divergent boards; +0.003 IMPs/board — the gain concentrates in the rare
  transfer/limit auctions it touches). No regression: the whole inference floor
  stays **+0.05 IMPs/board** (`inference-floor`, 20 000 boards, both
  vulnerabilities). Derived, not authored — no node per sequence.
- **`bba-match --our-system` — BBA-vs-BBA system comparison** (AI-bidder side
  experiment). The 2/1 eval-anchor example gains an optional flag that drives
  *our* side with a second EPBot card instead of the [`american`] floor, so the
  same engine bids both tables and every swing is a pure methods difference, with
  no bidding-skill confound. *Finding* (WJ / Polish Club, system 2, vs 2/1 Game
  Force, system 0; 10 000 boards each; double-dummy scored; swing credited to
  WJ): **+0.123 IMPs/board non-vulnerable** (95% CI [+0.051, +0.196]) and
  **−0.022 both-vulnerable** (CI [−0.111, +0.068], a statistical tie) — WJ holds
  a small constructive edge non-vul that washes out when both sides risk the big
  penalties; double-dummy is blind to WJ's obstruction value, so this reads as a
  *floor* on its real-table edge. Default (flag unset) keeps the S.1 anchor
  (`american` vs BBA 2/1) unchanged; no change to the crate's default build or
  dependencies.
- **A reverse-engineering study of BBA/EPBot's *floor*** (AI-bidder side study):
  a new report [`docs/ai-bidder/bba-floor.md`](docs/ai-bidder/bba-floor.md)
  answering how a mature engine bids where authoring runs out — the analogue of
  pons's [`instinct()`] floor. Findings: (1) `strace` shows `libEPBot.so` loads
  **no** external data files, so `MB.TXT` is a compiled-in export, not the
  runtime source; (2) static classification of all 6094 `MB.TXT` rules shows
  **66% are generic/parametric** (suit-variable templates, char-class ranges,
  constraint-only catch-alls) and specific literal-auction nodes are **shallow**
  (1–3 calls, vanishing past depth 5); weights are bimodal so broad floor rules
  (weight 0–9) always lose to specifics (90–99); (3) a live probe
  (`examples/bba-floor-probe`) confirms the compiled engine is **programmatic** —
  on deep off-book auctions its call escalates monotonically with the hand and it
  labels its own floor bids `"calculated bid"`. Throwaway reproducers
  (`scripts/bba_floor_stats.py`, `examples/bba-floor-probe/`) reuse the existing
  `bba-match` FFI; no change to the crate's default build, dependencies, or
  `instinct()` baseline.
- **South African Texas over 1NT — `4♣/4♦` to-play transfers and `4♥/4♠`
  non-forcing slam tries.** A 6-card-major responder gains a four-level structure
  on top of the two-level Jacoby transfers ([`american::notrump`]):
  - **`4♣ → 4♥`, `4♦ → 4♠`** (game, no slam, 9–14 HCP): jump transfers that put
    the opener in `4M` — identical in placement to the old `2♦/2♥`-then-game route,
    but *preemptive*, denying the opponents the two level they would otherwise
    balance in.
  - **direct `4♥/4♠`** (slam-invitational, 15–18): a non-forcing slam try. Opener
    passes the game with a minimum or launches RKCB 1430 with a maximum (17),
    reusing the existing [`american::slam`] ladder to place `6M` (or `5M` when
    missing two keycards). Because responder names the major first, the slam is
    responder-declared.

  The carve (weights 2.5/2.6 over the 2.0 Jacoby transfers; a `len(other major,
  ..5)` guard keeps 5-5+ two-suiters on the both-majors `3♦`; an HCP split routes
  game to the transfer and slam-invitational to the direct try) sends each 6-card
  hand to the right level. *Why it matters:* the prior bidder **could not bid a
  major slam after a Jacoby transfer** — the floor's `6M` milestone needs a
  `known_major_fit` (`partner_shown_len(major, 3..)`), which a transfer's
  completion never establishes — so those slams went unbid. The direct `4♥/4♠`
  defines the 6-card fit explicitly and bypasses the gap. *Measured* (`sat-ab`,
  seeded before/after duplicate match, 10M deals, opponents silent, double-dummy):
  **+2.53 IMPs/divergent board vul none, +3.78 vul both** — the divergent boards
  are the slam-invitational hands (21% of the 6-major class; the to-play `4♣/4♦`
  hands reach the same `4M`-by-opener as before, so they do not diverge); +0.54 /
  +0.81 IMPs per 6-major board.
- **`sat-slam-try` diagnostic example — the revised SAT `4♥/4♠` non-forcing slam
  try.** A follow-up to `texas-vs-sat`: in the *swapped* South African Texas,
  `4♣/4♦` are the everyday transfers (opener declares — declarer-equivalent to
  Texas) and a *direct* `4♥/4♠` is a non-forcing slam try, opener passing with a
  minimum or launching RKCB with a maximum. The to-play hands no longer diverge
  from Texas, so the example measures only the **slam-invitational** ones — where
  double-dummy *can* see the difference. Baseline = the current bidder; gadget =
  the opener-max keycard slam, modeled by hand. **Finding** (12M deals per
  vulnerability, ~3,600 configs each): **+1.38 IMPs/board vul none, +1.57 vul
  both.** The gadget reaches `6M` on ~17% of configs at a **94% double-dummy
  make-rate**, while the current bidder reaches slam only ~3%. *The catch:* much
  of the gain is the current bidder's **structural slam hole** — the floor's `6M`
  milestone requires a `known_major_fit` (`partner_shown_len(major, 3..)`), which
  a Jacoby transfer's completion never establishes, so the system cannot bid a
  major slam after a transfer. The gadget bypasses it; patching the floor would
  recover much of the same gain for *every* transfer auction. Now authored — see
  the South African Texas entry above; the seeded `sat-ab` A/B confirms the
  modeled gain on the real bidder.
- **`texas-vs-sat` diagnostic example — Texas vs South African Texas, the
  declarer question.** Measures the one *double-dummy-visible* difference between
  the two 4-level-transfer schemes: who declares `4M` on a 6-card-major
  game-but-not-slam hand opposite a strong 1NT — Texas (and the crate's current
  transfer-then-game) puts the **opener** in; South African Texas's direct
  `1NT–4♥/4♠` puts **responder** in. The DD/perfect-defense scorer is blind to
  *concealment* — the textbook reason Texas exists — so the example isolates only
  the residual opening-lead swing, and says so. **Finding** (600k deals per
  vulnerability, ~4,300 qualifying configs each): responder declaring scores
  **−0.052 IMPs/board vul none, −0.088 vul both** — opener declaring (Texas) is
  better *even on the concealment-blind metric*, the same direction as the larger
  effect double-dummy cannot see, and no hand feature (responder shortness
  included) flips the sign. The current treatment already declares from opener,
  so **no system change** — South African Texas is not adopted.
- **Both-majors response (1NT–3♦) — 5+/5+ in the majors, invitational+.** A 5-5
  major two-suiter previously had no one-bid home: it transferred and rebid the
  other major (clumsy, and game-forcing 5-5s fell through to the floor entirely).
  New nodes in [`american::notrump`]: responder bids `3♦` to show both majors
  (gated `points(8..)` so the 5-5 shape upgrade counts and weak 5-5s still take
  the transfer route; weight `2.1` outranks the `2.0` transfers). Opener picks the
  strain by strength — a **minimum (15–16)** signs off in three of the better
  major (`3♥/3♠`, spades-with-three else hearts), a **maximum (17)** jumps to the
  eight-card major game (`4♥/4♠`) or `3NT` when 2-2 in the majors. Over a minimum
  signoff responder passes the invitation or raises to game (`points(10..)`).
  Authored, not floored, for the usual reason — the keyless floor misreads `3♦`
  as natural diamonds and force-bids game. *Measured* (`stayman-abc`, seeded
  before/after duplicate match, opponents silenced, 200k boards, double-dummy):
  **+2.17 IMPs/divergent board vul none, +2.80 vul both** (5-5 INV+ is rare, ~0.05%
  of boards diverge). The `points(8..)` floor was tuned on the A/B (beats `7..`
  on per-divergent at tied total IMPs, and `9..` on both counts).
- **Puppet Stayman (1NT–3♣) and the minor-suit transfers (1NT–2NT diamonds,
  1NT–2♠ clubs/invite).** Three new constructive structures fill 1NT-response
  slots that previously carried no precision — a weak long-minor hand just passed
  1NT, a balanced game force blasted 3NT, and a 5-3 major fit was missed. New
  nodes in [`american::notrump`]:
  - **Puppet Stayman (`3♣`):** a game-forcing balanced hand with a three-card
    major hunts opener's five-card major. Opener shows it (`3♥/3♠`) or denies
    (`3♦`); over the denial responder bids the *shorter* major Smolen-style to
    show four in the longer, finding a 4-4 with opener declaring, else 3NT. The
    **2♣-vs-3♣ carve**: a 4-3 game force Puppets (it holds both a four- and a
    three-card major); a 4-4 or 4-(0-2) takes plain Stayman; invitational hands
    always take `2♣` (Puppet is game-forcing). `balanced()` keeps Puppet off
    shapely hands, which use the minor transfers instead.
  - **Diamond transfer (`2NT`):** 6+♦, or 5♦4♣. Opener completes to `3♦` only
    with three-card support (an assured eight-card fit), else `3♣` pass-or-correct
    so a 5♦4♣ hand can pick the better minor.
  - **Two-way `2♠`:** a club one-suiter (weak signoff, or game-going) or a
    balanced invitational eight. Opener shows strength — `3♣` maximum, `2NT`
    minimum — so responder pass-or-corrects safely: the invite plays `2NT`/`3NT`,
    weak clubs land in `3♣`, and a game-going club hand splinters (`3♦/3♥/3♠`) for
    opener to pick `3NT` vs `5♣`. The bare-8 invite **relocated here** from the
    old natural `2NT` (now the diamond transfer); min→2NT and max→3NT reproduce
    the old accept/decline outcomes, so that win is preserved, not reverted.
  - **Smolen reachability:** a game-forcing 5-4 in the majors now keeps off the
    Jacoby transfer (its `hcp(..9)` arm) and takes `2♣` Stayman, so the existing
    Smolen jump right-sides game to the strong notrump (the jump's floor dropped
    10→9 to match "force every 9"). A plain 5-3 still transfers.

  `Inferences::read` now reads a `2NT` response as the diamond transfer (5+♦), not
  an 8–9 points raise, and suppresses the new artificial relays/puppets/splinters
  from the natural suit reading so the floor and the search sampler are not
  misled. *Measured* (`stayman-abc`, a seeded before/after duplicate match — the
  change is structural, two binaries rather than a runtime toggle — opponents
  silenced, 60k boards, double-dummy): **+0.76 IMPs/divergent board vul none,
  +1.15 vul both** (~1.0% of boards diverge, so +0.0072 / +0.0109 IMPs/board
  overall), every divergent class net positive; the Smolen-reachability lever
  alone adds +0.0022 / +0.0030 IMPs/board. The `american_minor_transfers` test
  suite pins the new behaviour.
- **Stayman (1NT–2♣) is now fully authored — further bidding, Smolen, and the
  "ignore 2♣ ⇒ revert to notrump" rule.** Previously only opener's `2♥/2♠/2♦`
  answer was in the book; every continuation fell to the keyless floor, which
  misbid them — it reads any three-level suit response over our 1NT as
  *forcing*, so it force-bid game over an invitational Stayman raise and could
  never decline. New constructive nodes ([`american::notrump`]):
  - **After opener shows a major (`2♥/2♠`):** invitational raise (`3M`), game
    (`4M`), or — balanced or slam-interested — the **other major (`3OM`)** as an
    artificial slam try / choice of game. Opener answers `3OM` with `3NT` on a
    flat 4-3-3-3, the cheapest control cue on a maximum, else the major game.
    Opener accepts the invitational raise into the major game with a maximum
    (`3NT` only on a flat 4-3-3-3), passes a minimum.
  - **Without a fit, "ignore the 2♣ detour":** `2NT` invites, and `3NT`/`4NT`
    are bid exactly as over a bare 1NT — so `4NT` is quantitative (16–17), opener
    accepting `6NT` with a max.
  - **Smolen:** with game-forcing 5–4 in the majors, responder jumps in the
    four-card major to show *five* in the other (`1NT–2♣–2♦–3♥/3♠`), so the strong
    notrump declares; opener completes to game in the long major. Mirrored at the
    **2NT-strength** level (`…3♣–3♦–3♥/3♠`).

  The judgement that *is* sound for the keyless floor stays there: `Inferences::read`
  now reads the 1NT–2♣ auction (opener's answer pins a four-card major or denies
  both; responder's `2♣` and invitational continuations pin strength), feeding the
  sampler behind `american_search()` and any competitive fallback, while the
  artificial `3OM`/Smolen jumps are suppressed from the natural suit reading rather
  than misread as long suits. *Measured* (`stayman-abc`, a seeded before/after
  duplicate match — the change is structural, so the two arms are two binaries
  rather than a runtime toggle — opponents silenced, 60k boards, double-dummy as in
  `nt-invite-abc`): **+1.38 IMPs/divergent board vul none, +2.03 vul both**
  (~0.9% of boards diverge, so +0.013 / +0.019 IMPs/board overall), every divergent
  board class net positive. The `american_stayman` test suite pins the new behaviour.
- **Opener accepts a 1NT–2NT invitation — via the inference, not a node.**
  `american()` previously *passed* a `1NT–2NT` invite even with a maximum: opener
  was blind to responder's strength because `Inferences::read`'s notrump-raise
  reading was gated to one-of-a-suit openings, so a raise of our *own* 1NT opening
  showed nothing. Teaching the inference that `1NT–2NT` shows an invitational ≈8 and
  `1NT–3NT` is game-going 9+ (naturally; the artificial Stayman/transfers stay
  silent) lets the **keyless floor judge game itself** — it already knew "bid game
  when the combined range suffices", it just couldn't see responder. With the fix,
  **both `american()` (the deterministic instinct floor) and `american_search()`
  accept opposite a maximum (3NT) and decline opposite a minimum (Pass)** — no
  hand-authored acceptance node, in keeping with "smarten the floor, don't author a
  node per bid". *Measured* (`nt-invite-abc`, opponents silenced, 60k boards/cell):
  consistently positive, **+1.96 IMPs/divergent board vul none, +4.48 vul both**
  (~0.1% of boards, so +0.002–0.004 IMPs/board overall), zero regression. Gated by
  `set_nt_invite_inference(bool)` (default on) for the A/B and as a regression
  guard. *Deferred* (future session): apply the same inference treatment to the
  other partially-authored notrump continuations — invitational/game sequences
  after transfers and Stayman, and natural raises of the 2NT opening (the
  `nt-range-split` diagnostic below still shows ~23 such hands the book under-bids).
- **Responder forces game with 9+ over 1NT (was: invite 8–9, force 10+).** A/B
  verification of "upgrade the 9-count to a game force": opposite a 15–17 notrump a
  flat 9 makes game often enough that the invitational stop loses more by missing
  games (opener declining with a useful minimum) than the occasional 24-count game
  costs. *Measured* (constructive A/B, opponents silenced, 120k boards/cell, forcing
  every 9 vs inviting 8–9): **+0.98 IMPs/divergent board vul none, +2.91 vul both**
  (+0.0016 / +0.0046 IMPs/board), zero regression. Deciding the 9 by Thomas Andrews's
  tempered **Fifths** instead (force good 9s, invite quack-heavy ones) was measured
  *worse* — even low-Fifths 9s gain ≈+0.9 IMPs/divergent when forced, so the
  selective threshold just leaves games unbid (matching Andrews's own caveat that
  the fractional valuation does not help at the 1NT invitation boundary). So the
  blunt HCP threshold wins; responder's 2NT is now a bare-8 invitation and `3NT`
  shows 9+. The inference (above) was updated to match.
- **`Inferences::narrowed_points` + the `nt-range-split` diagnostic (AI-bidder).**
  The new `Inferences::narrowed_points(who, range)` returns a copy with one player's
  shown points intersected to a sub-range — the seam for splitting a 1NT opener's
  shown range into halves and sampling layouts from each (`sample_layouts`). The
  `nt-range-split` example uses it as an *oracle*: opposite openers from each half it
  scores the best NS game against the best NS partscore double-dummy (game good
  opposite both → FG, the upper half only → INV, neither → PASS — the meaning of an
  invitation), and compares that verdict to where `american()` lands by bidding the
  `1NT–Pass` auction out. This is what *found* the invite-acceptance gap above (the
  empty INV column); after the inference fix its disagreement drops 26.4% → 22.8%
  (the residual is the deferred transfer/Stayman continuations). Plan:
  `docs/ai-bidder/`.
- **Meckstroth adjunct — opener's invitational `3m` jump after a forcing 1NT
  (and `1♥–1♠`), now the default.** After `1M–1NT` or `1♥–1♠`, opener's
  medium *shapely* hands (5-5 / 6-5, ≈15–17 points) previously had no
  descriptive rebid and underbid as a natural two-level minor; opener now jumps
  to **`3♣`/`3♦` to show 5+ of the minor, invitational**, and responder accepts
  game with a maximum (4M with a 5-3 fit, else 3NT) or declines to a preference
  in opener's five-card major. The strong 2NT rebid is left as the
  forcing-to-game/strong slice (its existing natural continuation already drives
  responder to game opposite a 6+ forcing 1NT, so the full artificial relay
  ladder is deferred). Disjoint by strength: 18–19 balanced → 2NT, 15–17 with a
  five-card minor → `3m`, a minimum → the natural two level. Gated by
  `set_meckstroth_adjunct(bool)` (default on); the new `meckstroth-abc` example
  is the constructive A/B harness. *Measured* (opponents silenced, 50k boards
  per cell): consistently positive across all three vulnerabilities on both
  points and IMPs — **+0.67 IMPs/divergent board vul none, +1.38 vul ns, +1.43
  vul both**, with zero regression. The situation is rare (~0.25% of boards), so
  the whole-match figure is +0.002–0.004 IMPs/board; the win is real but
  low-frequency.
- **`american_wide_6322()` — experimental 6322-minor 1NT option.** A
  `NotrumpShape` enum (`Balanced` / `Wide` / `Wide6322`) now selects the 1NT
  opening shape; `Wide6322` adds a 6322 with a six-card minor on top of the
  shipped `Wide` (5422-minor) default. Kept as an option, **not** the default: a
  constructive ablation had found the 6322 addition net-neutral, but a
  *contested* re-test (`nt-shape-contested --baseline wide --redesign wide6322`,
  100k boards) shows it is worth **+0.52 IMPs/divergent board vul none and +0.64
  vul both** (~2.8–3.6σ) — the 6-card minor's preemptive value pays off only in
  competition. Adopting it as the default is gated on the deferred inference pass
  (a 6-card suit breaks the current "1NT opener is 2–5 in every suit" inference,
  which a 5422 satisfied but a 6322 does not). The `nt-shape-contested` example
  gained `--baseline`/`--redesign` flags to compare any two shape policies.
- **Wider 1NT opening shape, now the default.** The strong 1NT (`american`)
  opens not only the balanced patterns (4333/4432/5332) but also a **5422 with a
  five-card minor** — a five-card major still prefers a one-of-a-major opening it
  can rebid, and a 6322 (either suit) keeps opening its long suit (an A/B
  ablation showed any-5422 *loses* by burying the major fit, and the 6322
  addition was net-neutral, so both are left out). Strength (`fifths` 15–17) is
  unchanged; this is a shape-only change. The pre-change balanced-only system is
  preserved as `american_classic()` (the A/B baseline). *Measured*
  (5422-minor wide vs balanced classic): **constructive** A/B (`nt-shape-abc`,
  opponents silenced) +0.32 IMPs per divergent board; **contested** A/B
  (`nt-shape-contested`, opponents bidding, 100k boards) +0.57 IMPs/divergent vul
  none and **+0.93 vul both** — a clear, statistically solid win that grows with
  competition and vulnerability, exactly the modern rationale. The shape fires on
  ~1% of boards, so the whole-match figure is +0.006–0.009 IMPs/board. The
  opening inference stays **sound** (the `opening_inference_contains_the_opener`
  proptest passes at 200k cases — a 5422 fits the existing "each suit 2–5, 14–19
  points" 1NT inference); *tightening* it to convey the possible five-card minor
  is left for the deferred evaluation/inference pass.

- **Rubens (transfer) advances of a simple overcall, in the instinct floor.**
  When partner makes a *simple* (non-jump) suit overcall of a one-level opening
  and RHO passes, advancer's calls from the cue up to a two-level raise are
  transfers to the next suit — a new-suit transfer shows a five-card suit and
  **10+ upgraded points** (a *good* 9 and all 10+, since the transfer commits
  partner to the two level), and the transfer that lands in partner's suit is a
  limit-plus raise; over a two-level overcall, where there is no room for the
  ladder, the cue itself is the limit-plus raise. Jump overcalls are preemptive and advance naturally, as
  do advances of preemptive openings. The convention is implemented once,
  *programmatically*, in the keyless floor: `overcall_shape` /
  `advance_of_overcall` derive the transfer band for every (opening, overcall)
  pair, so one rule set serves all of them (a per-suit authored table could
  not), and the meaning is mirrored in `Inferences` — the transfer/cue suit is a
  relay, not a holding (suppressed), while a cue-raise is read as three-plus
  support and ten-plus points so the overcaller can still reach game. Partner's
  instinct therefore completes the transfer mechanically and never misreads it.
  The floor now **owns advancing a simple overcall**: the books' raises-only
  `advances()` — which returned a degenerate result on hands it could not
  classify, such as a five-card side suit with no support — is removed from
  the 2/1 defensive book, and the floor's Rubens transfers,
  natural raises, and a weak preemptive jump cover the position. *Measured:*
  floor worth preserved at **+1.03 IMPs/board** (instinct-floor A/B, 8000 boards,
  vul none), with transfers confirmed firing in the off-book telemetry; against
  BBA's 2/1 (`bba-match`, 2000 boards, vul none) **−2.02 IMPs/board vs −2.13
  pre-Rubens** — neutral-to-slightly-positive, no regression from moving
  advances to the floor. Eleven tests: floor and inference unit tests plus four
  full-system integration rails (new-suit transfer, limit-raise transfer,
  preemptive raise, two-level cue-raise).
- **`constructive-abc` example + `american_constructive_floor` builder.**
  The neural/search floors only ever own the *contested* books — unbooked
  *constructive* auctions are always answered by the deterministic `instinct()`
  milestone ladder. This A/B/C harness measures whether that partition leaves
  points on the table: it silences the opponents (East/West always pass) so every
  auction is constructive, bids each board three times — `instinct()`,
  `SearchFloor`, `NeuralFloorSearch` floored onto the *constructive* book — over
  the same deal, solves it once double dummy, and reports the pairwise IMP swings.
  The new `bidding::american::american_constructive_floor(floor)` builder
  (gated `neural-floor`) exposes the constructive-floor knob the standard
  constructors hard-wire to `instinct()`; the example is gated `search` and the
  search arm dominates runtime (~seconds/board), so `--layouts`/`--shortlist`
  trade strength for speed. No change to any shipping bidder — purely a new
  measurement path and an added builder. First run (2000 boards, none vul, 45%
  divergent): the bare net `NeuralFloorSearch` loses **0.8 IMPs/board** to
  `instinct()` on constructive auctions, while the live `SearchFloor` ties it
  (+0.002) — the search rescues a weak constructive prior with real cardplay,
  the bare net cannot. Confirms the partition: the milestone ladder is the right
  constructive floor and the learned floors stay contested-only.
- **`scripts/fleet/` — distributed data-gen.** A small ssh harness that spreads
  the CPU-bound double-dummy dumps (`search-dump` / `teacher-dump`) across several
  machines without manual syncing. Because a dump is deterministic given
  `(git SHA, seed)` and its `.f32`/`.tags` rows are independent and concatenable,
  distribution needs no daemon or queue: `run.sh` partitions the seed space into
  one shard per seed and dispatches them with GNU `parallel --sshloginfile`
  (each remote run still wrapped in `scripts/idle-run.sh` for SCHED_IDLE
  politeness), pulls the shards back with `rsync`, and `merge.sh` validates the
  sidecars agree (feature/layout/system/SHA) and `cat`s them into one dump the
  off-crate trainer reads unchanged. It pins the coordinator's SHA and refuses
  any host not on it (skew would silently corrupt the dataset), builds on each
  host (so it is arch-agnostic), `--resume`s incomplete shards on re-run, and
  self-balances across heterogeneous hosts (`-j1` = one all-core solver per box,
  faster boxes grab more shards). Copy `hosts.example` to `hosts` to use.
- **`calibrate-eval` example**: regresses double-dummy tricks on the partnership
  hand evaluators (HCP, Fifths, BUM-RAP, LTC, NLTC, Zar, CCCC) using the
  precomputed 100k-deal database `sol100000.txt` — **no DD solving**, so it is
  fast and cannot overfit the bidder. It decodes that file's **GIB** format
  (West-first deal; 20 hex DD cells over strains `NT,S,H,D,C` × declarers
  `E,N,W,S`, with East/West stored as `13 − tricks`; verified against the
  solver) and reports, per evaluator and per context (notrump vs an 8+-card
  trump fit), the trick mapping (slope, intercept, residual σ, R²) and a
  concentration term `c·|eᴺ − eˢ|` that measures non-additivity. Hands taking
  fewer than 6 double-dummy tricks are dropped (never bid), and the survivors
  are further split into partscore (6–8), game (9–11) and slam (12–13) zones,
  each reporting the strength `Σ` it requires and its own linear `tricks = b·Σ + a`
  fit. Findings: the evaluators are essentially perfectly additive (`c ≈ 0`);
  BUM-RAP/Fifths fit notrump tricks best while Zar/CCCC win the suit fit; NLTC
  clearly beats LTC; the textbook "tricks = 24 − losers" base is empirically
  closer to 22 (NLTC) / 20 (LTC); and the slope flattens sharply toward slam
  (an extra notrump HCP is worth ≈ 0.4 tricks overall but only ≈ 0.05 in the
  slam zone — slams are decided by controls and fit, not raw points).

- **Tag features for the neural floor** (AI-bidder **M5.1**): a second, opt-in
  feature-spec version that feeds the **WBF tags of the recent calls** into the
  policy net as categorical inputs. A new `bidding::tags` module lifts the
  structural tag reader (`derive`, `infer_book`, the `TAGS` vocabulary, and
  `tag_multihot`) out of `examples/export-corpus` so the corpus exporter and the
  featurizer share one source of truth (the exporter's output is byte-identical).
  `features::features_v2` returns the v1 160-float vector followed by a
  multi-hot of the last `TAG_WINDOW` (= 4) calls' tags over the 21-tag
  vocabulary — **244 floats**, version 2 — with each prior call read by the same
  `derive`, recovering its book from the auction via `infer_book`. The net is
  trained, distilled, and embedded exactly as v1: `bidding::neural::classify_v2`
  (hand-rolled forward pass, now dimension-parameterized and bit-matched to the
  trainer on a fixture), the `NeuralFloorV2` safety shell (same forced-rail
  delegation + legality mask), and `american_neural_v2()` (gated behind
  `neural-floor`; `american()` stays the baseline and `american_neural()`
  the v1 floor — an added option, never a removal). The off-crate trainer and
  `teacher-dump` are now **layout-agnostic**: `teacher-dump --features-version 2`
  emits the v2 dump, the trainer sizes the model input from the dump sidecar, and
  **v1 dumps still load unchanged**.
  **Measured** (20 000-board duplicate A/B, vul none): the tag block improves the
  *distillation fidelity* (held-out top-1 agreement with the teacher 95.0% vs the
  v1 net's 93.8%, val cross-entropy 0.235 vs 0.249) but lands at **parity on
  IMPs/board vs v1** (−0.016 IMPs/board, 95% CI [−0.039, +0.007] — within noise),
  while preserving the floor's worth over bare books (+0.540 IMPs/board, CI
  [+0.495, +0.585], containing the +0.5 baseline) and the teacher-clone parity
  (−0.015 vs the deterministic floor). The expected reading: for *pure teacher
  distillation* the deterministic teacher is the ceiling, so richer inputs buy
  fidelity, not table result; the tag infrastructure is in place to pay off when
  the floor is distilled toward a better-than-teacher search target (M3.2). New
  artifact `src/bidding/weights/american_v2.{f32,json,fixture.json}`; no new
  crate dependencies; the default build is unchanged.
- **Search-target neural floor** (AI-bidder **M3.2**, round 1): a third distilled
  floor, trained toward the **double-dummy search teacher's** EV-grounded targets
  (the M3.1 `search-dump`) instead of the deterministic teacher — same v1 features
  and 160→256→256→38 shape, only the training target differs. `neural::classify_search`
  (hand-rolled forward pass, bit-matched to the trainer on a fixture), the
  `NeuralFloorSearch` safety shell (the *same* forced-rail delegation to `instinct()`
  + legality mask as the v1/v2 floors), and `american_neural_search()` (gated
  behind `neural-floor`; `american()` and `american_neural()` stay the
  baselines — an added option, never a removal). Trained on the 10 000-board dump
  (97 701 rows, git_sha `1d43577`): held-out fit to the *richer* search target is
  val-CE 0.776, top-1 89.4 % constructive / 73.8 % contested — looser than the
  near-deterministic teacher clone *by design*, since the search softmax is a
  higher-entropy distribution. **Measured** (20 000-board duplicate A/B, vul none):
  **+0.787 IMPs/board vs the v1 teacher-distilled net** (95 % CI [+0.718, +0.857]),
  and +0.700 vs the deterministic floor ([+0.630, +0.770]) and +0.816 vs bare
  books — a decisive gain, concentrated **off-book/competitive**. The high divergence
  (75 % of boards) is the net reaching makeable games/slams the conservative v1
  misses, *not* overbidding: against double-dummy par (small slam makeable on
  10.65 % of deals, grand 2.94 %) the search net in fact **under**-bids slams
  (4.0 %/1.7 %) while v1 is the pathological under-bidder (≈0). A
  perfect-defense-doubling rescore — DD the optimistic bound, PD the pessimistic —
  **brackets** the gain and it survives both: search vs v1 holds at 0.35 IMPs/board
  under PD (vs 0.79–0.86 under DD across two 20k samples), CI excluding 0; search vs
  the deterministic floor 0.40 under PD. The `examples/neural-floor` A/B now prints
  both views per matchup. Only the single-dummy haircut (deferred — needs a cardplay
  engine) stays unquantified. New artifact
  `src/bidding/weights/american_v1_search.{f32,json,fixture.json}`; no new crate
  dependencies; the default build is unchanged. Iteration (round 2: regenerate
  targets with this net as the search policy) is deferred.
- **`scoring::ns_score_doubling_failures`** — a sibling of `ns_score` that scores
  a contract under **perfect-defense doubling**: any contract failing
  double-dummy is scored *doubled*, a making one keeps its auction penalty. This
  is the per-deal form of the par scorer's long-standing `min(undoubled,
  doubled)` heuristic in `stats::average_ns_par` (now documented and named at
  both sites). It is the EV evaluator's new scorer (see *Fixed*). Also adds a
  gated `grand-probe` diagnostic example (behind the `search` feature) that
  replays the search self-play, measures the DD make-rate and a points-vs-IMP
  recompute at each 7NT node, and has a `--census` mode tallying the
  advancing-call level histogram — the regression check that the grand flood
  stays gone.
- **Search-improved distillation targets** (AI-bidder **M3.1**): a new gated
  `search-dump` example (behind the `search` feature) that bids out random boards
  with the M2.3 live double-dummy search floor and records, at every decision, a
  training row of `(features, search_target)` — the improved call distribution the
  net is distilled toward in M3.2. The output is **byte-identical in layout to
  `teacher-dump`** (a flat little-endian `f32` file of `160 + 38 = 198` floats per
  row, a `.json` sidecar, and a `.tags` file), so the off-crate trainer consumes it
  unchanged; the only difference is the target, which the search improves on the
  teacher exactly where the books were silent (the file is a trainer-compatible
  *superset* of `teacher-dump`, identical on book nodes and upgraded off-book). The
  `.tags` byte gains a second bit (`bit1` = off-book / search fired, alongside the
  existing `bit0` = contested phase). The example also prints and records **the
  M3.1 measure**: at each row it classifies the deterministic teacher
  (`american`) and the raw net prior (`american_neural`) and reports, split
  by off-book/on-book and contested/constructive, the arg-max disagreement rate and
  the mean total-variation distance — confirming the targets differ from the teacher
  *mainly off-book* (on-book rows are `0` by construction; a 40-board smoke run shows
  ~51 % arg-max disagreement and ~0.53 mean TV off-book vs `0`/`0` on-book). A small
  additive constructor, **`american_search_with(SearchFloor)`** (gated `search`,
  re-exported at the crate root), lets data-generation runs trade strength for speed
  via the `--layouts`/`--shortlist`/`--temperature` knobs; `american_search()`
  is now exactly `american_search_with(SearchFloor::default())`. No change to the
  default build, the safety shell, or the `instinct`/`search_floor` rails; no new
  crate dependencies.
- A **BBA/EPBot eval anchor** (AI-bidder Side-track S, S.1): a new `bba-match`
  example that pits our deterministic `american()` floor against **BBA's own
  2/1 Game Force card** (EPBot system 0, verified by name) in an A/B duplicate
  match — apples-to-apples, so every divergence is a pure quality gap in our DSL,
  not a difference of methods. A `BbaOracle` implements pons's public `System`
  trait by driving a fresh EPBot bot per decision (configure all four seats,
  deal the actor's hand, replay the auction with `epbot_set_bid`, read the call
  with `epbot_get_bid`), with the dealer canonicalized to position 0 so
  `classify` stays a pure function of `(hand, vul, auction)`. The S.0 ABI was
  generalized to full auctions: `epbot_set_bid(bot, position, bid, meaning)` and
  `epbot_set_system_type(bot, position, system)` were decompiled and confirmed,
  the ten is EPBot-canonical `T` (`Holding`'s `Display`, verified via
  `epbot_get_cards`), and an earlier "crash on the second bot" was traced to a
  pointer-truncation bug in a throwaway probe, not the library. The harness
  reuses the `instinct-floor`/`scoring`/`ddss` machinery, reports IMPs/board with
  a 95% confidence interval, and dumps the worst divergent boards (the deal plus
  both tables' auctions) as concrete authoring targets. Measured at 2000 boards,
  vul none: **−2.59 IMPs/board, 95% CI [−2.83, −2.35]** — our floor trails a
  mature engine by ≈ 2.6 IMPs/board, the gap concentrated in competitive/
  contested auctions (where the books are thinnest). Still purely external
  tooling: a `libloading` **dev-dependency** only, the proprietary binary stays
  git-ignored under `/vendor/`, and the crate's default build, dependencies, and
  `instinct()` baseline are untouched.
- A **BBA/EPBot reference-bidder spike** (AI-bidder Side-track S, S.0): a new
  `bba-oracle` example that drives Edward Piwowar's EPBot engine as a black-box
  bidding oracle to benchmark our bidding against a mature, rule-based system —
  the way the open-source BEN engine was trained on BBA-bid deals. EPBot ships a
  self-contained native Linux library (`libEPBot.so`, .NET-NativeAOT), so the
  example `dlopen`s it and calls the `epbot_*` C ABI **directly — no Wine, no
  .NET runtime, no subprocess**. The undocumented ABI was recovered (objdump +
  a pure-Python decompile of `EPBotFFI`) and is documented inline: `epbot_create`/
  `_new_hand`(7 args; the four holdings as one `'\n'`-joined string)/`_get_bid`/
  `_destroy`, plus the bid-code encoding (`0/1/2 = Pass/X/XX`, contract =
  `5 + (level-1)*5 + strain`). The spike bids known hands to their textbook 2/1
  openings. Purely external tooling: a `libloading` **dev-dependency** only, the
  proprietary binary stays git-ignored under `/vendor/`, and the crate's default
  build, dependencies, and `instinct()` baseline are untouched. The full harness
  (complete auctions + a `BbaOracle` `System` + the 2/1 A/B match) is S.1, planned
  in [`docs/ai-bidder/plan.md`](docs/ai-bidder/plan.md) "Side-track S".
- A **behavioral constraint verifier** (M4.2 of the AI-bidder effort): a new
  ungated `bidding::verify` module that checks a candidate `Constraint` *accepts
  the right hands*, complementing M4.1's round-trip check that it *renders* to the
  right gloss. M4.1's `describe().to_string() == gloss` is a string compare, so it
  is blind to the body of a `described("label", closure)` escape hatch (only the
  label renders) and to whether a primitive's bounds match looser human intent
  when porting. `verify::compare(reference, candidate, rng, n)` samples `n` random
  hands and returns a `Report` (accept rates plus a bounded sample of
  counterexample hands) of where the two disagree; `accepts`/`predicate` adapt a
  `Constraint` to the comparison, a book `Rule`'s public `eval` serves as the
  porting oracle (`compare_against_rules`), and `check_examples` checks a
  constraint against hand-labeled intent. A new `tests/dsl_verify.rs` is the
  milestone measure — it catches a battery of deliberately-broken constraints
  (the canonical "5+ ♥" mis-compiled to `len(♥, 4..)`, off-by-one bands, a
  swapped `&`/`|`, dropped/extra clauses, and a `described` closure that uses `>`
  where intent is `≥`) while faithful recompiles agree. A new `verify-constraint`
  example runs the M4.3 porting loop on real book data: it pulls the 1♠ opening
  from the 2/1 books and shows a faithful recompile (0 disagreements) versus a
  broken one (caught, every counterexample a four-card spade hand), then the
  escape-hatch blind spot (two "prefers diamonds" closures that render
  identically yet disagree on equal-length hands). Offline tooling; nothing
  learned ships, and the instinct/neural/search rails stay green.
- A **DSL authoring-compiler spec** (M4.1 of the AI-bidder effort):
  [`docs/ai-bidder/dsl-spec.md`](docs/ai-bidder/dsl-spec.md) is a precise,
  pasteable English→`Constraint` prompt — the grammar (the `&`/`|`/`!` tree and
  how `describe()` renders it), a vocabulary table for every primitive with
  their exact glosses and range conventions, the `described(...)` escape-hatch
  discipline, gold `(English, Rust)` pairs harvested from the live 2/1 books, and
  explicit compile instructions. It turns book authoring into "write the meaning,
  verify, commit": an LLM proposes a
  `Constraint`, deterministic Rust verifies it. The spec is offline tooling;
  nothing learned ships. A new `tests/dsl_roundtrip.rs` is that mechanical check —
  it pins every primitive gloss and the combinator/range rendering against
  `describe()`, and reproduces 12 held-out real rules from their gloss alone (100%
  exact round-trip), so the spec is provably sufficient and `describe()` cannot
  drift from it unnoticed. The behavioral verifier (accept/reject over random
  hands) is the next milestone, M4.2.
- A **self-describing constraint DSL** (M4 of the AI-bidder effort, the
  authoring compiler's foundation): `Constraint::describe()` now renders any
  authored constraint to canonical English, the inverse of `eval()`. Until now a
  `Constraint` was eval-only and opaque — once built as `Arc<dyn Constraint>` you
  could run it but never read what it *meant*, and the corpus exporter had to
  re-guess descriptions structurally from the bid shape, divorced from the real
  logic. Now every primitive names itself (`hcp(15..=17)` → "15–17 HCP",
  `len(Spades, 5..)` → "5+ ♠", `support(3..)` → "3+ card support for partner")
  and the combinators compose those: `&` reads as a comma list ("12–21 points,
  and 5+ ♠"), `|` as ", or", `!` as "not (…)", with nested groups parenthesized.
  The new public `Description` tree carries the structure (so a terse WBF-tag
  renderer can be added later without touching primitives) and `impl Display`
  prints the prose. This is the readable face of a book — the meaning is read
  straight from the logic it bids on, so author and reader cannot drift, and it
  is the verification substrate the later English→`Constraint` LLM compiler will
  round-trip against. **Non-breaking and behaviour-preserving:** `describe()` has
  a default (`Opaque`) so external impls compile unchanged, the ~21 primitives
  were turned from anonymous closures into named structs with byte-identical
  `eval`, and the full instinct/neural/search rails stay green.
- `bidding::constraint::described(label, condition)` — a labeled escape hatch: a
  one-off predicate that carries its own meaning, where a bare `pred()` renders
  `Opaque`. Used to label the books' bespoke predicates (better-minor selection,
  Michaels/Unusual length comparisons, the RKCB keycard/queen/king holdings), so
  every node in the 2/1 corpus now describes truthfully.
- `bidding::rules::Rule::describe()` — the meaning of a rule's call, read from
  its constraint.
- A `render-book` example: prints the floor-less 2/1 books as readable prose —
  each auction, then per call its weight and the constraint's own English
  description — including the full RKCB 1430 ladder ("exactly 2 keycards, and
  holds the ♠ queen"). A stderr coverage metric counts any rules still opaque (0
  for the corpus books).
- The `export-corpus` exporter now emits a truthful `constraint` field from
  `Rule::describe()` and makes it the default `description` (precedence: a
  hand-authored `note()` label, then the truthful constraint render, then — only
  for a bare opaque predicate — the structural gloss). At 770 nodes / 2314
  records the corpus is now **0 opaque**: every record carries its real meaning,
  not a re-guessed one. The `tags` field (the controlled WBF vocabulary) is
  unchanged.
- `bidding::search_floor::SearchFloor` and `american_search()` behind a new
  `search` feature — the gated live double-dummy search bidder (M2.3 of the
  AI-bidder effort, completing Milestone 2). This is "simulations in action": at
  each non-forced decision the floor *thinks* before it bids. It wears the same
  deterministic safety shell as the neural floor — auction-determined forced
  situations delegate to `instinct()` verbatim, so the §0.4 rails hold by
  construction — but in the judgement middle it no longer trusts the net's single
  forward pass. Instead the net is only a *prior*: it shortlists the top-`k` legal
  calls, prices each by cardplay over `n` sampled layouts with `ev_all` (the M2.2
  evaluator), and re-seats the evaluated calls onto an EV-ranked band above the
  prior tail, so the driver bids the highest-EV call while every legal call keeps
  a sane fallback logit and `Pass` stays finite. "Net proposes, search disposes."
  The rollouts finish under self-play with our own distilled net
  (`american_neural()`) — the continuation policy M3.2 will iterate. The knobs
  (`layouts`, `shortlist`, `temperature`) default to *strength, not latency*
  (`n = 128`, `k = 8`, ≈ 1.4 s per decision — `n` and `k` raised together so the
  wider shortlist's extra candidates are scored against tight EV estimates, not
  noise); shrink them for a faster, noisier bidder. `classify` stays
  a pure function despite sampling: the rollout RNG is seeded deterministically
  from the decision's feature vector, so the same hand and auction always yield
  the same logits (invariant §0.5). The `search` feature implies `neural-floor`
  (it needs the prior net and the forced-rails shell); the default build,
  `instinct()`, and `american()` are untouched — this is an added gated
  option, never a replacement. Seven gated tests cover the five §0.4 rails against
  the shelled search bidder, determinism, and the EV-band ordering. A gated
  `search-floor` example A/Bs it against the deterministic floor (it should beat
  the hand-written ladder) and against the distilled net (search should beat the
  raw policy it proposes from). The search is slow by design — every decision is a
  double-dummy search — so a real interval needs a long run; the live bidder is
  also the teacher whose improved EVs M3 will distill back into a fast forward
  pass.
- `bidding::ev::{ev, ev_all}` — the call-EV evaluator (M2.2 of the AI-bidder
  effort). For a candidate call it answers the question the rule books never
  could: *what is this call worth?* — by Monte-Carlo rollout grounded in
  cardplay. It samples layouts with `sample_layouts`, seeds the candidate onto
  the prior auction, lets a continuation policy bid each layout out, scores the
  contract reached double dummy, and averages the result in the actor's favour.
  `ev_all` scores a slate of candidates over the *same* layouts and a single
  double-dummy solve per layout, so the cost is `n` solves rather than `k · n`;
  `ev` is the one-call wrapper. The continuation policy is a `System` parameter,
  not hardwired — callers pass the deterministic `american()` for now, and
  the M3 search-improvement loop will swap in successive nets without touching
  this code; all four seats bid the same policy (a self-play assumption). EVs are
  average scores in points (positive good for the actor); a call illegal in the
  prior auction, or an auction so tight no layout can be sampled, scores `NaN`
  (read as *no signal*). The evaluator is ungated. Five tests cover the ranking
  sanity (a sound game out-values a hopeless grand, which prices out negative),
  determinism under a fixed seed, the illegal-candidate and infeasible-auction
  `NaN` paths, and the empty-slate case. This evaluator is the shared engine
  behind both the M2.3 live search bidder and the M3 offline training targets.
- `bidding::sampler::sample_layouts` — the constrained layout sampler (M2.1 of
  the AI-bidder effort, starting Milestone 2). The inverse of `Inferences`: given
  the player to act, their hand, and their seat, it deals the other three hands
  at random so that LHO, partner, and RHO each fall within their shown length and
  point ranges. It pins the actor's thirteen cards into a partial deal and
  rejection-samples on top of `contract_bridge::deck::fill_deals`, so accepted
  layouts satisfy every range by construction; an attempt budget bounds tight or
  infeasible auctions, which may return fewer layouts than requested rather than
  loop forever. This is the substrate the M2.2 call-EV evaluator will score each
  candidate call over by double dummy. The sampler is ungated — the natural
  completion of `Inferences`, which was built for exactly this — and takes the
  caller's RNG, so the learned floor stays deterministic. Six tests cover
  soundness (a property test over random hands), the count being met on feasible
  auctions, non-degenerate coverage, and termination on an infeasible auction.
- `bidding::constraint::point_count` — the upgraded-points scalar (raw HCP plus
  the fuzzy-strength `upgrade`) that the suit-oriented `points` constraint gauges
  and that `Inferences` records its point ranges on. A single definition now
  shared by the new sampler and the `Inferences` soundness test, so the value can
  never drift from the ranges checked against it.
- `rand` is now a direct dependency (`0.10`). It was already compiled
  transitively via `contract-bridge`'s `rand` feature, so the dependency tree is
  unchanged; the sampler simply names it directly to take the caller's RNG.
- `bidding::neural_floor::NeuralFloor` and `american_neural()` behind the
  `neural-floor` feature — the safety shell that makes the distilled net usable
  as a floor (M1.3 of the AI-bidder effort, completing Milestone 1). The shell is
  a drop-in `Classifier`: in auction-determined forced situations (partner's live
  takeout double, an auction that forces game, a just-made transfer over our
  strong notrump) it delegates to the deterministic `instinct()` ladder verbatim
  — the learned net is never trusted on the rails — and everywhere else it
  returns the net's logits legality-masked with `Auction::can_push`, keeping
  `Pass` finite so a distribution always exists. `american_neural()` mirrors
  `american()` with this floor swapped in; the deterministic `instinct()`
  floor stays the default and baseline (nothing is removed, an option is added).
  Five gated tests pin the five §0.4 safety properties against the shelled net.
  Hand-conditioned game forces are left to the net as judgement, measured by the
  example below, not hard-railed.
- `examples/neural-floor` behind the `neural-floor` feature — the A/B measurement
  for the learned floor (M1.4 of the AI-bidder effort). Two duplicate matches
  with 95% confidence intervals: the neural floor against the deterministic floor
  (the distillation parity target) and against bare books (the floor's worth).
  At 8000 boards (vul none) the neural floor is at parity with the deterministic
  floor — −0.01 IMPs/board, CI [−0.05, +0.03], containing zero — while preserving
  the floor's gain over bare books (+0.59 IMPs/board, CI [+0.52, +0.66], against
  the hand-built floor's recorded ≈ +0.5). The distilled floor *equals* the
  hand-written one on the harness; the machine now does the floor's job.
- `bidding::neural` behind the new `neural-floor` cargo feature — the in-crate
  forward pass for the distilled floor (M1.2 of the AI-bidder effort). A
  hand-rolled `f32` matmul + ReLU that embeds the trained `american_v1`
  weights with `include_bytes!` and evaluates `classify(features) -> Logits`
  with no ML dependency. The feature is off by default, so the standard build is
  byte-for-byte unchanged. A parity test reproduces the trainer's candle logits
  on the exported fixture within `1e-3` and matches the arg-max (chosen call)
  exactly. The deterministic safety shell — legality masking and forced-situation
  overrides — follows in M1.3.
- `trainer/` — the off-crate distillation trainer (M1.1 of the AI-bidder
  effort). A self-contained cargo workspace built with `candle` that is never
  compiled by the `pons` build (an empty `[workspace]` table decouples it, and
  the crate carries no ML dependency). It fits a `160 → 256 → 256 → 38` MLP to
  the teacher's softmax by soft-target cross-entropy and exports the weights as
  a flat little-endian `f32` artifact plus a versioned sidecar and a
  forward-pass parity fixture into `src/bidding/weights/`. On a 484k-row dataset
  it reaches ≈94% held-out top-1 agreement with `american()` (validation
  cross-entropy 0.25 against a 0.20-nat teacher-entropy floor). The weights ship
  in-repo for M1.2 to embed and run by a hand-rolled forward pass; the library
  itself is unchanged.
- `examples/teacher-dump` — the distillation dataset generator (M0.4 of the
  AI-bidder effort, completing Milestone 0). Bids out random boards with
  `american()` and writes one `(features, teacher_softmax)` row per decision
  to a flat little-endian `f32` file (160 features + 38-way softmax = 198 floats
  per row) plus a JSON sidecar pinning the feature version, teacher, seed, git
  SHA, and counts, plus a sibling `.tags` file (one `u8` per row marking
  contested-phase decisions) so the trainer can split held-out agreement by
  phase. A dev tool, not part of the library API.
- `examples/export-corpus` — the description-corpus exporter (M0.2 of the
  AI-bidder effort). Walks the floorless 2/1 books, recovers each authored node
  through `Classifier::as_rules()`, and emits one JSONL record per `(node, call)`
  with WBF tags derived structurally from the auction (and the rule's `note`
  label as the description where present). A dev tool, not part of the library
  API.
- `bidding::rules`: rules can now carry a human-readable `label` (M0.1 of the
  AI-bidder effort). `Rules::note("…")` chains after `rule(…)` to label the
  preceding rule, `Rule::label()` reads it back (empty by default, so the
  authored books are unchanged), and `Classifier::as_rules()` downcasts a
  type-erased trie classifier back to its authored `Rules` — the hook the
  description-corpus exporter uses to recover each node's calls and labels.
- `bidding::features` — a versioned feature extractor (M0.3 of the AI-bidder
  effort). `features(hand, context)` returns a `Vec<f32>` of exactly 160
  values (`FEATURES_LEN`) encoding five blocks: per-suit rank/length/honor
  indicators (76), global hand evaluations (HCP, upgraded points, Fifths,
  CCCC, NLTC, balanced flag — 6), laws-only auction facts (our/their strains,
  contract-to-beat, partner's last bid, penalty, seat, we-opened — 36),
  inferences per seat (length ranges, point ranges from `Inferences::read` —
  40), and relative vulnerability (2). Layout is versioned as
  `FEATURES_VERSION = 1`; block offsets are exported as `OFFSET_*` /
  `LEN_*` constants.
- `bidding::constraint::cccc_at_least`, gating on the Kaplan–Rubens CCCC
  ("Four C's") evaluation newly available as `contract_bridge::eval::cccc`
  (validated bit-for-bit against Richard Pavlicek's published distribution
  over all 635,013,559,600 hands). CCCC weighs honor placement together with
  shape, making it the right gauge for suit contracts; Fifths remains the
  gauge toward notrump, especially 3NT. The `check-nltc` example gains a CCCC
  column: on 2000-deal pair sums it correlates 0.72 with par suit-contract
  tricks, in the same league as BUM-RAP+ (0.75) and ahead of NLTC.
- `bidding::constraint::points`, the fuzzy-strength gauge: raw HCP plus an
  `upgrade` (also exported) for clean unbalanced hands. An unbalanced hand
  whose short suits (≤ 2 cards) waste no honors gets +1, and +1 more with ten
  or more cards in its two longest suits; any A/K/Q/J in shortness voids the
  upgrade, except the working Ax and Kx. Balanced hands never upgrade, so
  `points` coincides with `hcp` for them.
- `bidding::constraint::fifths`, gating on Thomas Andrews's computed point
  count for 3NT (an `f64` range on the same 40-point scale as HCP).
- The `fuzzy-strength` example: an A/B duplicate match where the same 2/1
  books bid with fuzzy strength on one side and raw HCP on the other, via a
  per-thread ablation hook read at classification time. `--policy
  points|fifths|both` ablates the two gauges separately.
- `bidding::inference`, a per-player summary of what the calls have shown —
  each suit's length range and the point range — accumulated across an auction
  and derived purely from the calls under standard 2/1 meanings (`Inferences`,
  `Inference`, the inclusive `Range`, and a `Relative` seat). It fills the gap
  the eval-only `Constraint` leaves: a `len(..)` rule's length cannot be read
  back out, so the summary is reconstructed from the calls (like the instinct
  floor's `Interpretation`). Every range only ever *narrows*, so a hand that
  made the calls always falls within it — the soundness the future constrained
  sampler relies on; the deriver stays silent on artificial structures
  (Stayman, transfers, the strong-2♣ responses) rather than misread them.
- `bidding::constraint::partner_shown_len` and `partner_shown_points`, crisp
  predicates reading partner's guaranteed minimum from `Inferences` — what
  partner's calls *promised*, where `support` grades what *our* hand holds.
- The `inference-floor` example: an A/B duplicate match measuring the
  inference-aware floor against the pre-inference floor via the
  `set_inference_aware` ablation hook.

### Changed

- **Refreshed the Transfer Lebensohl A/B numbers in the 21GF ledger (ledger #80)
  after the relay/floor/stretch updates above.** Re-measured on the current book
  (`lebensohl-ab`, 200k filtered/cell, seed 20260620, perfect-defense): `Transfer`
  vs `off` is now −0.010/−0.022 IMPs/board (−0.103/−0.226/div, none/both), up from
  −0.048/−0.065; `Transfer` vs `plain` is +0.049/+0.082 board (+0.873/+1.463/div).
  Documentation only — no code change.

- **Transfer Lebensohl after a takeout double is now the default advance (was
  opt-in `Off`).** After `(2X)–X–(P)` the advancer now carries `Transfer`
  Lebensohl by default — `set_advance_sohl_style`'s default flips from `Off` (the
  flat `advance_double` ladder) to `LebensohlStyle::Transfer`. A deeper
  perfect-defense re-measure (200k filtered boards/cell, both vulnerabilities)
  makes it a clear win over the flat ladder: **+0.145 / +0.227 IMPs/board**
  (none/both; reproduced +0.139/+0.234). The earlier "DD-neutral → keep opt-in"
  verdict was an artifact of the optimistic scorer (corrected by the `ns_score`
  perfect-defense fix). `Plain` also flips DD-positive (+0.089/+0.139, was
  −0.108/−0.050) but stays dominated. `set_advance_sohl_style(LebensohlStyle::Off)`
  recovers the prior flat-ladder default; `Plain` / `Rubensohl` remain selectable.
- **`scoring::ns_score` now assumes perfect-defense doubling (breaking); the
  optimistic variant is removed.** A contract that fails double dummy is now scored
  *doubled* — a competent defense always doubles what it can beat, so in a
  double-dummy model the opponents always hold the red card and pricing a failing
  overbid undoubled modelled an opponent who *cannot* double. This folds the old
  `ns_score_doubling_failures` behavior into `ns_score` and **removes
  `ns_score_doubling_failures`** (it is now redundant). Every A/B harness that
  scored with plain `ns_score` (`instinct-floor`, `inference-floor`,
  `leaping-michaels-ab`, `lebensohl-ab`, `stayman-abc`, `nt-shape-contested`, …)
  is corrected to perfect defense by this one change; `neural-floor`'s dual
  optimistic/perfect-defense reporting collapses to the single (now correct)
  measure. The cardplay EV evaluator (`bidding::ev`) is unaffected — it already
  used the doubling behavior. *Consequence:* convention A/Bs previously reported on
  the optimistic bound (Leaping Michaels, Transfer Lebensohl, Stayman, the 1NT
  redesigns, the BBA gap, …) should be re-validated under perfect defense, since
  competitive conventions can shift most where overbids go doubled.
- **Renamed the `two_over_one*` system to `american*` (breaking).** The 2/1
  game-force system is now named by identity: `two_over_one` → `american`
  throughout. The module `bidding::two_over_one`
  → `bidding::american`; every function follows (`two_over_one()` → `american()`,
  `_classic`, `_wide_6322`, `_neural`, `_neural_v2`, `_neural_search`, `_search`,
  `_search_with`, `_constructive_floor`, and `bare_two_over_one()` →
  `bare_american()`), as do the crate-root re-exports. The `export-corpus`
  `--system` value `two-over-one` is now `american`,
  and the example `cargo run --example two-over-one` is now `--example american`.
  Bundled neural weights were renamed in step (`weights/american_v{1,2}.f32`,
  `american_v1_search.f32`). Prose still calls the system "2/1" / "Two-over-One
  Game Forcing" — only identifiers and names changed.
- **The optional search-target neural floor (`american_neural_search()`) is
  now the round-2 net (AI-bidder M3.2 / M3.3).** The M3.1 search-dump was
  regenerated with the round-1 net as the rollout continuation policy *and* the
  doubling-aware `ev_all` (104 476 rows / 10k boards), then distilled into the
  same `160→256→256→38` net at the same hyperparameters. The new weights replace
  the old ones in place — the public API, the safety shell, and `instinct()` (the
  default and baseline) are untouched. **A/B (20 000 boards), round-2 vs round-1,
  on the default perfect-defense measure** (failing contracts priced doubled, as
  real opponents would): **+1.661 IMPs/board vul none** (CI [+1.550, +1.772]),
  **+2.069 vul both** (CI [+1.957, +2.181]) — round 2 learned to *stop reaching
  doubled-down contracts*, the discipline its doubling-aware targets reward.
  Beats the deterministic floor on the same measure (+0.178 vul none, +1.716 vul
  both; CIs exclude 0), so it is the M3.3 champion. On the optimistic double-dummy
  bound (which scores down contracts undoubled) the round-1→round-2 step is parity
  vul none (+0.046, CI [−0.034, +0.127]) and a gain vul both (+0.424), so round 2
  is never worse on either bound.
- **The neural-floor A/B harness now reports perfect-defense doubling as the
  default measure, double-dummy as the optimistic bound.** `examples/neural-floor`
  used to headline the double-dummy swing — which prices every failing contract
  undoubled, i.e. as if the opponents passed it out instead of doubling what they
  can beat — and relegate perfect-defense doubling to a sub-line. The head-to-head
  verdict now runs on the PD swing; the DD swing is still printed as the optimistic
  bound. (The vs-bare floor-worth target stays on DD: PD vs a passing opponent is a
  scorer artifact, since bare never owns a failing contract.)
- **The `fifths` strength gauge no longer scores Fifths alone — it averages
  Fifths with an honor-weighted companion.** Fifths is tuned for 3NT (it
  rewards aces and tens, discounts kings and queens), so it misjudges an
  *initial* notrump bid that may yet land in a suit contract. Every
  `fifths(...)` range — the 1NT/2NT openings, opener's 1NT/2NT rebids, and the
  balanced descriptions in the game-force, Jacoby, and strong-2♣ structures —
  now bands the **average of Fifths and a companion count**, halving the 3NT
  bias toward a real-honor scale. The notrump *raises* (1NT–2NT, 1NT–3NT,
  quantitative 4NT) are unaffected; they already gauge plain `hcp`, which is
  where Fifths-alone would have been fine anyway. A new `FifthsCompanion` enum
  and `set_fifths_companion` hook (both `#[doc(hidden)]`, A/B only) pick the
  companion: **BUM-RAP is the default**, chosen by the new `fifths-companion`
  A/B example — it edged Milton Work HCP across every vulnerability (combined
  −0.28 IMPs per divergent board to the HCP team over 120k boards, ~2.9σ;
  whole-match ≈ −0.01 IMPs/board, as only ~2% of boards diverge). User-visible
  effect: a tens-rich light hand can no longer sneak into a notrump range on
  Fifths, and a quack-heavy hand is no longer shut out of one.
- **The live-search floor's rollout continuation is now self-play against the
  search-target net (AI-bidder M3.2 round 2).** `SearchFloor`'s `POLICY` — the
  policy that finishes every rollout auction so `ev_all` can score a candidate —
  was the teacher-distilled `american_neural`; it is now
  `american_neural_search` (the M3.2 round-1 net). Each round's distillation
  targets are thus scored by the previous round's policy: "feed the improved net
  back into the continuations." Behind the `search` feature; affects
  `american_search` only.
- **The `practice-bidding` example now bids with the learned floor by default.**
  A new `--floor` flag selects the bots' (and the "Bot's opinion" feedback's)
  floor: `neural-search` (the M3.2 search-distilled net) or `instinct` (the
  deterministic ladder). The default is `neural-search` when built with
  `--features neural-floor`, else `instinct`, so the no-feature build still
  compiles and runs. The deterministic floor was only ever the pre-AI-bidder
  default; with the net compiled in, practice now feels what the net plays.
- **The instinct floor is now a milestone bidder, and it floors the constructive
  book too.** Two coupled changes, worth **+1.12 IMPs/board** (instinct-floor A/B,
  4000 boards, up from ≈+0.5 for the old contested-only floor):
  - *General game/slam selection.* The floor's game bidding was special-cased to
    three forced auctions (strong-notrump responder, strong 2♣, takeout-double
    advance). It now also fires on a general trigger: our own `point_count` plus
    the **sound floor** of partner's shown points (`Inferences::partner().points.min`)
    reaching a milestone — 25 for game, 33/37 for small/grand slam. Below game it
    takes the cheapest milestone (a known eight-card major fit → 4M, else 3NT,
    dropping to 5m only when a suit they bid is unstopped); in the slam zone it
    bids 6M/6NT/7M/7NT. Because the trigger reads the *guaranteed* minimum, it
    never overbids a hand that could be weaker than counted — it only stops
    passing out cold games.
  - *Constructive flooring.* `with_floor` now attaches the deterministic instinct
    ladder to the **constructive** book as well, not just the contested books.
    Uncontested off-book auctions previously fell through to a pass — e.g.
    `1♦–1♥–1NT` was passed out on a balanced 16 opposite the 12–14 rebid, a cold
    3NT (the learned neural/search floors don't help here: they are wired onto the
    contested books only). They now reach the milestone. `american_strawberry`
    floored the constructive book by hand for the same reason; that is now the
    default and its bespoke block is gone.
- **The auction inference reads limited rebids and raises.** `Inferences` now
  narrows the shown point range for opener's 1NT rebid (12–16) and **jump** 2NT
  rebid (18–21, the slam-enabling minimum), the single (6–10) and limit (10–12)
  raise, and the 1NT response (6–12) — each a sound bound, read only when the
  opponents stay silent (a competitive 2NT or raise can be off-meaning). A latent
  bug in the highest-contract tracker (`outranks` ranked strain before level, so
  `2♣` did not outrank `1♠`) was fixed in passing; it gated the jump detection the
  new readings rely on. Sharper partner-strength is what lets the milestone floor
  reach slams.
- **BBA/EPBot is now bundled as a git submodule.** With redistribution permitted
  by its author (free for non-commercial use), the reference engine that the
  `bba-match` and `bba-oracle` examples benchmark
  against ships as the `vendor/bba` submodule (`github.com/EdwardPiwowar/BBA`,
  pinned). Fetch it with `git submodule update --init vendor/bba` and the
  examples' default library path resolves — no manual download or `BBA_LIB`
  needed. The submodule is excluded from the published crate, so the packaged
  tarball is unchanged. Published comparison numbers credit EPBot as the
  reference engine.
- **The 2/1 system is now sharp on shape, fuzzy on strength.** Roughly a
  hundred rule sites across openings, responses, raises, rebids, the
  game-force structure, Stenberg, weak twos and their Ogust ladder, strong
  2♣, competition, defense, Rubens advances, and the instinct floor swap raw
  `hcp` for `points` wherever strength gates a suit-oriented call — including
  caps, so a clean shapely maximum upgrades *out* of a weak two. Boundary
  pairs (an overcall cap and its double-then-bid floor) convert together so
  no upgraded hand falls between bands.
- Notrump-defining ranges (1NT/2NT openings, opener's balanced 12–14 / 18–19
  / 22–24 / 25–27 rebids, the 13–15 and 15–17 balanced 3NT rebids) gauge
  `fifths` over half-open bands (`hcp(15..=17)` → `fifths(15.0..18.0)`), so a
  queen-heavy 20-count now opens 1♣ planning a 2NT rebid while a ten-rich
  14-count upgrades into the strong notrump. Responder's notrump ladders
  (including the whole BTU structure) intentionally stay on raw HCP for a
  follow-up. The last-resort 1NT rebid fallbacks became unconditional
  (`hcp(0..)`) so light or off-band openers always retain a book call.
- **The instinct floor now reads partner's shown shape.** In a forced-to-game
  auction it bids a *known* eight-card-plus major fit (our five-card suit
  opposite partner's shown three-card support, or our support opposite
  partner's shown five-card suit — e.g. opposite our 1NT after partner's
  natural, forcing three-level major) rather than the shape-blind 3NT.
  Measured by the `inference-floor` example over 20,000-board A/B matches, it
  scores non-negative at every vulnerability (+0.00 to +0.01 IMPs/board, ~1.5
  to 3 IMPs per divergent board) while diverging on only ~0.3% of boards — the
  triggering auctions are rare, so the gain is small but real and never a
  regression.
- Measured by the `fuzzy-strength` example over 20,000-board A/B matches per
  configuration, the combined policy scores level with raw HCP (runs between
  −0.04 and +0.03 IMPs/board, within noise at this sample size) while
  diverging on ~21% of boards. Ablated at 20,000 boards apiece, each half
  alone also measures −0.01 IMPs/board (`points` diverging on 17% of boards,
  `fifths` on 5%). The policy is kept for its descriptive value — sharper
  announced ranges at equal measured strength — and the ablation hooks stay
  for tuning the halves separately.

### Removed

- **True Rubensohl (`LebensohlStyle::Rubensohl`).** The `2NT`-club-transfer /
  two-way-low-transfer variant of Lebensohl — added earlier this cycle as an opt-in
  fourth style — is removed, along with `rubensohl_responder`,
  `complete_two_way_transfer`, `two_way_transfer_rebid`, and their wiring in both the
  overcalled-`1NT` and takeout-double-advance contexts. It never measured a win
  (its only edge over the default `Transfer` is DD-blind right-siding:
  `+0.001/−0.023 IMPs/board` head-to-head, neutral non-vul / a loss vul), and the
  `Transfer` refinements that prompted a fresh look (top-step clubs transfer, delayed
  cue, `(2♦)` Smolen) don't port onto it — its transfer machinery consumes the very
  seams those refinements use. The remaining styles are `Off`/`Plain`/`Transfer`;
  the default and `american()` are unchanged. The `--ns rubensohl` / `--ew rubensohl`
  options on `lebensohl-ab` and `sohl-after-double-ab` are gone.
- **The strawberry 2/1 variant (`american_strawberry`,
  `bare_american_strawberry`) and its three convention modules.** This was a
  `NATURAL`-family 2/1 with a few polish.club conventions layered on — Strawberry
  Stenberg 2NT (`stenberg`), BTU strong-1NT responses (`btu_notrump`), and a
  **book** overlay of Rubens transfer raises (`american::rubens`). The book
  Rubens collided with the new floor Rubens: it authored the transfer raise only
  for 10–12 points, so a game-strength raise leaked past it to the floor's
  cue-raise, giving the *same* limit-plus raise two different (and strength
  inverted) calls. Rather than maintain two Rubens implementations, the variant
  is dropped; the keyless floor's Rubens is the single source of truth. The
  conventions remain in git history if ever wanted.
- **The in-development second system and the `nltc` / `nltc_at_most` DSL
  constraints.** The project refocuses on a single mature 2/1 (`american`)
  system, on top of which other systems can later be built. The second authored
  system (`polish_club()` / `bare_polish_club()`, the `Family::POLISH_CLUB`
  constant), its `polish-club-reference` and `bba-wj-reference` examples, and the
  `export-corpus --system` selector are dropped — `export-corpus` now always
  walks the 2/1 books. The two NLTC *constraint* primitives `nltc(range)` and
  `nltc_at_most(losers)`, used only by that system, are removed; the NLTC hand
  *evaluator* (`eval::NLTC`, the `bba-match`/`bba-oracle` 2/1 reference, and the
  `calibrate-eval` example) is unaffected. `nltc_at_most` shipped in 0.9.0, so
  its removal is breaking for any direct user. Everything remains in git history.
- **The direct `serde_with` dependency.** It was wired into the `serde` feature
  but never referenced — no `#[serde_as]`, no custom (de)serialization anywhere
  in the crate. Dropped from `[dependencies]` and from the `serde` feature list.
  No API change: `serde` derives on the stats and inference types are unaffected,
  and `serde_with` is still pulled transitively by `contract-bridge`/`ddss` (for
  *their* serde impls) when `--features serde` is enabled.

### Fixed

- **`examples/grand-probe` now declares `required-features = ["search"]`** so
  `cargo build --examples` (no features) no longer fails resolving the
  `search`-gated `search_floor`/`american_search_with` imports it uses.
- **A partial book node no longer shadows the floor: a hand it rejects now
  falls through to the floor instead of producing a degenerate all-`-∞`
  result.** A book node admits only the calls whose constraints match the hand,
  so a deliberately partial node — the codebase's "partial nodes, the floor
  catches the rest" design — left a hand it did not cover with no probability
  mass. Resolution returns the most specific (exact) node first and only walks up
  to the `Always`-guarded floor when *no* exact node matches, and the classify
  wrappers did not check the result for mass — so the partial node shadowed the
  total floor and the driver, finding no finite call, silently passed (the 7NT
  degenerate-result report). Resolution is now **mass-aware**: `Trie` gains
  `classify_floored`, which consults the exact node first and, only when it
  yields no mass for the hand, walks up to the fallback chain — reaching the
  always-total instinct floor. The bare-book ablation (no floor attached) is
  unchanged: it still returns no mass and the driver passes. Telemetry benefits
  too — `classify_with_provenance` now attributes the floor (`depth == 0,
  fallback == Some(_)`) on a fall-through, the "next node worth authoring"
  signal. No authored node changed; the only behavior difference is for hands
  that previously degenerated. Regression tests in `trie`.
- **The instinct floor's 3NT game milestone now requires a stopper in their
  suits, so it never bids notrump game into an unstopped enemy suit in a
  competitive auction.** The milestone game/slam ladder already fires in
  competition (an overcall shows 8+, a takeout double 11+, and the combined-points
  trigger has no "uncontested" guard), and its slam and minor-game rules already
  gate on `stopper_in_their_suits()` — but the plain 3NT game rule did not, so a
  game-values hand opposite a competitive overcall could bid 3NT with the
  opponents' long suit wide open. The guard is **vacuous when uncontested** (no
  suit of theirs to stop), so constructive auctions are unchanged; only contested
  ones differ — a stopperless, fitless game-values hand now passes (or competes)
  rather than bidding a doomed notrump. Floor worth on the `instinct-floor` A/B is
  preserved (6000 boards: **+1.10 IMPs/board** vul none, **+0.40** both), and the
  telemetry confirms the floor's competitive judgement firing — milestone games
  (`3NT  1♦ P 1♥ P 2♦ P`) and reopening takeout doubles (`X  1♦ 1♠ P P`) — in the
  off-book tail it owns.
  openings gate on `fifths` (which downgrades quack-heavy hands), but the
  inference layer recorded their point ranges on the raw-HCP scale, so a balanced
  quack-heavy 19-count (e.g. ♠KQJx ♥KQx ♦KQx ♣Kxx — 17.6 fifths) opened 1NT yet
  fell outside the announced 14–18. Because `hcp − fifths ≤ 1.6`, the sound
  envelopes are 1NT **14–19** (was 14–18) and 2NT **19–23** (was 19–22); the
  inference now uses them. Caught by the `opening_inference_contains_the_opener`
  proptest (intermittent: it needed a quack-heavy draw). Announced NT point
  ranges widen by one at the top; no bids change.
- **`grand-probe` example and the AI-bidder doc comments compile cleanly under
  the CI lint gates** — the `grand-probe` example tripped `needless_range_loop`
  and `redundant_closure` (clippy `-D warnings`), and ~20 intra-doc links in the
  bidding modules were unresolved or ambiguous under rustdoc `-D warnings`. Both
  gates had been red since the AI-bidder modules landed; fixed with no behavior
  change.
- **Call-EV evaluator now prices contracts under perfect-defense doubling**
  (AI-bidder, M3.1 follow-up). The cardplay rollout already assumes optimal
  defense, but it left the *doubling* decision to the weak continuation policy,
  which under-doubles — so a failing sacrifice priced at its cheap *undoubled*
  penalty and the live double-dummy search chased phantom saves into runaway
  competitive auctions (probing the M3.1 `search-dump` targets found 7NT chosen
  as often as games, on ~0%-making hands, purely because the rollout never
  doubled the save). `bidding::ev::ev_all` now scores every layout with
  `scoring::ns_score_doubling_failures`: a contract that fails double-dummy is
  scored *doubled*, extending the perfect-defense assumption to the penalty. In a
  50-board census this cut slam-or-higher advancing calls from **12.6% to 0.4%**
  (grand slams **6.2% → 0%**) and the count of off-book search decisions by
  **62%** — the auctions stop spiralling once saves are priced honestly. This
  changes only the gated `search` floor and the distillation targets it produces;
  `instinct` and the distilled neural floor are untouched.
- The instinct floor no longer passes a game-forcing 2♣ auction out below 3NT.
  The strong 2♣ opening is forcing for one round only; it is responder's
  *answer* that settles the game force — the 0–3 HCP double negative (2♥) keeps
  the option to stop short, while the waiting 2♦ or any positive commits both
  partners to at least game. The floor now reads that force off responder's
  call (its second convention, after the strong notrump), so off-book
  continuations such as `2♣ – 2♦ – 2NT` reach 3NT or the cheapest major game
  instead of dying in a partscore, while `2♣ – 2♥ – 2NT` may still be passed.
  The forced-to-game rules (for both the 2♣ and strong-notrump conventions)
  also step aside whenever we are penalizing the opponents with a double of our
  own, so a game force never pulls partner's penalty double of a partscore.
  Instinct now reconstructs this forcing state through a small `Interpretation`
  of the auction it owns, keeping system interpretation out of the mechanical
  `Context`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added

- `scoring`: per-board scoring primitives promoted from the `instinct-floor`
  example so every simulation harness shares one scorer —
  `final_contract(auction, dealer)` (the last bid with its doubles and the
  absolute declarer), `ns_score(result, tricks, vulnerability)` (the signed
  NS score of a final contract priced from a double-dummy `TrickCountTable`,
  0 for a pass-out), and `imps(diff)` (the standard WBF scale). The
  `instinct-floor`, `practice-bidding`, and `defend-2sx-or-3nt` examples now
  use these instead of private copies.
- `Table::bid_out_from`: continue a seeded auction (positioned from the
  dealer) until it ends; `Table::bid_out` is now this with an empty seed.
  This is the driver for forcing an auction prefix and letting the systems
  finish the board, as the `defend-2sx-or-3nt` example does with its
  `(2♠) X (P) + decision` seeds.
- `american_strawberry()` (with its floor-less `bare_american_strawberry()`
  ablation), an opt-in variant of the 2/1 system that layers in three optional
  conventions from the author's *Strawberry Polish Club* notes
  (<https://polish.club>), each chosen to stay applicable to a 2/1 framework,
  while leaving the canonical `american()` untouched for A/B comparison.
  Exported at the crate root alongside `american`. To avoid authoring a node
  per artificial continuation, the variant also floors its *constructive* book;
  with the strong-notrump instinct rules a game-forcing 1NT auction reaches game
  even where the book stops (covered by an end-to-end test that plays full
  auctions through the stance).
  - **Strawberry Stenberg 2NT** (`stenberg`) replaces Jacoby 2NT as opener's
    rebid after `1M – 2NT`: the cheapest step shows a minimum, every other rebid
    a maximum that describes a side fragment, a five-card side suit, or a
    two-suiter, with RKCB 1430 below the agreed major.
  - **BTU responses to the strong 1NT** (`btu_notrump`) replace the baseline
    1NT response block — BTU Stayman 2♣ (with the invitational 5=♠ relay and
    Smolen), Jacoby transfers 2♦/2♥ with super-accepts, minor-suit transfers
    2♠/2NT, Puppet Stayman 3♣, splinters, South African Texas, and the
    quantitative ladder — while keeping the 2NT-strength and 18–19-rebid
    structures shared with the baseline.
  - **Rubens (transfer) advances** (`rubens`) overlay the defensive book: over
    partner's overcall, the step just below partner's suit is a limit-plus
    transfer raise that partner completes.
- The `practice-bidding` example: an interactive harness for judging the
  bidding books by sitting at the table. It shuffles random boards — optionally
  rejection-sampled against `--min-hcp` / `--max-hcp` / `--min-suit` bounds on
  your hand — and lets you bid one seat while pons bots bid the others:
  `--bots 3` seats bots at all three other chairs, `--bots 1` gives you a bot
  partner against silently passing opponents for uncontested practice. After
  each of your calls it prints the book's top three candidates with softmax
  weights and tracks your agreement rate with the bot's first choice. When the
  auction ends it reveals the deal and renders two double-dummy verdicts via
  `ddss`: the final contract scored on the actual layout (with the par score
  for reference, both signed from your side), and its make rate, mean score,
  and trick range across `--simulations` reshuffles of the two unseen opposing
  hands with your side's cards held fixed.
- `bidding::instinct`: the instinct bidder, a keyless floor for off-book
  auctions. `instinct()` is one context-driven `Rules` ladder that answers
  *every* auction with a sane natural action: penalty pass only with a trump
  stack, raises of partner's suit with three-card support and rising strength
  per level, notrump and five-card-suit overcalls when we have not bid,
  takeout doubles of their low suit bids, and pass. Partner's *live takeout
  double* (the auction ends `… (bid) X (Pass)` with their suit bid at the
  three level or below doubled) is recognized mechanically and never passed
  without a trump stack — the advance ladder guarantees an action down to a
  cheapest-notrump escape. Every instinct call is natural, so the floor stays
  coherent when both partners land on it; strength-showing cue-bids are
  deliberately excluded until both sides of the convention can be authored.
  Floor activations are observable as `Provenance { depth: 0, fallback:
  Some(_), .. }` from `Trie::resolve` — in simulation, the most-hit auctions
  are the next nodes worth authoring properly.
- `bidding::constraint`: `they_bid(strain)` and `short_in_their_suits()`
  (takeout shape: at most three cards in each suit the opponents have bid),
  promoted from private helpers in the 2/1 books.
- `Stance::classify_with_provenance`: the same routing and logits as the
  `System` implementation, plus the resolution `Provenance` — the telemetry
  hook for counting instinct-floor activations (`depth == 0` with `fallback`
  set) and ranking which off-book auctions to author next.
- `bidding::american::bare_american`: the 2/1 pair *without* the
  instinct floor — the ablation handle; `american()` is now this pair
  with the floor attached.
- `instinct-floor` example: an A/B duplicate match (floored vs bare 2/1 on
  identical boards, swings scored double dummy and credited to the floored
  team in points and IMPs) plus floor telemetry (activation rate and the
  most-hit off-book auctions). First run: the floor is worth about +0.5
  IMPs/board against its own absence, and the telemetry's top entries —
  later-seat openings falling off the defensive book — drove the seat-fan
  fix above.
- `bidding::american::defense_to_weak_two` and `advance_double`: defense to
  the opponents' weak twos and advancing partner's takeout double, filling the
  one gap the `defend-2sx-or-3nt` example needed. The defensive book now
  answers a `(2♦/2♥/2♠)` opening with a takeout double, a natural 15–18 2NT
  overcall, and cheapest-level suit overcalls; `advance_double` answers
  `(opening) X (P)` for advancer with a penalty pass on a trump stack, a
  major-suit game jump, 3NT with a stopper, cheapest-level new suits, and a
  lebensohl-style escape to the cheapest notrump. Bid levels are derived from
  the opening, so the one advancer builder serves both one-bids and weak twos
  (it is now also registered after `(1x) X (P)`).
- `bidding::context`: `Context`, the mechanical auction context passed to
  classifiers and constraints — vulnerability (relative to the side to act),
  the raw table auction, and facts derived from it (bid strains per side,
  partner's last bid, the contract to beat, doubling state, passed-hand and
  seat facts, `min_level`). Also `context::relative(AbsoluteVulnerability,
  Seat)`, the only vulnerability conversion in the crate: drivers convert
  once per `classify` call, and systems pass the relative value through
  unchanged.
- `bidding::constraint`: a composable constraint vocabulary for authoring
  rules. A `Constraint` maps `(Hand, &Context)` to a logit contribution;
  crisp predicates return `0.0`/`-∞`. Primitives: `hcp`, `len`, `balanced`,
  `nltc_at_most`, the context-relative `support`, `stopper_in_their_suits`,
  `passed_hand`, `undisturbed`, `vulnerable`, `they_vulnerable`, `nth_seat`,
  and the `pred` escape hatch. Constraints compose with `&` (sum, AND for
  crisp), `|` (max, OR), and `!` (crisp flip) on the `Cons` wrapper.
- `bidding::rules`: `Rules`, an ordered rule list acting as a `Classifier`.
  Each `Rule` ties a call to a constraint with a weight (soft priority); a
  call's logit is the **max** of `weight + constraint` over its rules.
  `Rules::explain` reports the winning rule per call — "why did you bid
  that".
- `bidding::fallback`: guarded fallbacks generalizing the trie over
  competitive auctions. `Trie::fallback_at` attaches ordered `(Guard,
  Fallback)` entries to a node; `Trie::resolve` answers from the exact book
  first, then walks up from the deepest reachable node taking the first
  admitted fallback, reporting a `Provenance` (depth, entry index, rebase
  count). `Fallback::Rebase` rewrites the auction and re-resolves (at most
  `REBASE_LIMIT` times) — "system on over their double" is
  `FirstIs(Call::Double)` + `ReplaceNext(Call::Pass)` instead of a copied
  subtree. Stock guards: `Always`, `Undisturbed`, `FirstIs`,
  `OvercallAtMost`.
- `bidding::compose`: lazy `System` combinators. `a.vs(b)` composes a table
  where `a`'s partnership is the dealer's side, dispatching purely by
  auction-length parity; the opposing slot is also where an approximate
  opponent model goes. `a.or_else(b)` layers `a` over a fallback system,
  falling through on `None` or logits without probability mass. A blanket
  `impl System for &S` lets `(&a).vs(&a)` work without cloning.
- `bidding::book`: role-aware pair books, split three ways by the `Phase` of
  the auction. A `Constructive` book covers the strictly uncontested auctions
  (openings keyed per seat by their leading passes, and the continuations
  while the opponents only pass), a `Competitive` book covers the auctions
  where we open and they intervene (negative doubles, "system on" rebases),
  and a `Defensive` book covers the auctions where they open (overcalls,
  doubles, defense). All three wrap and deref to `Trie`; each adds a *gated*
  `System` impl that answers only for its phase. `Phase::of(&[Call])` is the
  single routing point that assumes a standard pass — forcing/strong-pass
  openings stay out of scope (use a bare `Trie`).
- `bidding::book`: `Pair` and `Stance` — a pair's authored system and its
  bound form. A `Pair` assembles the three books with a `Family` identity (an
  open `&'static str` newtype with stock constants such as `NATURAL` and
  `STRONG_CLUB`; downstream systems mint their own) plus optional
  per-opponent-family overrides (`competitive_vs`, `defensive_vs`), because
  what the competitive and defensive books mean depends on the opponents'
  system. Binding happens once at table assembly: `pair.against(them)`
  selects the books for that opposing family and returns a `Stance`, the
  `System` that classifies by `Phase`. `against` merges a structural clone of
  the constructive trie into the bound competitive trie (classifiers stay
  `Arc`-shared), so a competitive rebase such as "system on over their
  double" lands in the uncontested core; constructive-phase queries use the
  unmerged constructive trie, so no competitive fallback can leak into
  undisturbed auctions. Seat-dependent systems (e.g. transfer openings in
  1st/2nd seat only) need no extra machinery — each seat already has its own
  subtree under its leading-pass prefix — and vulnerability-dependent
  agreements are authored with the `vulnerable()`/`they_vulnerable()`
  constraints.
- `bidding::table`: `Table`, the absolute-seat table driver. It seats two
  systems as North/South and East/West with a dealer and an
  `AbsoluteVulnerability`, rotates the seat to act, converts the
  vulnerability once per call, filters illegal calls with the contract-bridge
  law (`Auction::can_push`), and bids a deal out (`classify`, `next_call`,
  `bid_out`). `Table::of_pairs(ns, ew, dealer, vul)` binds two `Pair`s
  against each other's families and seats them. `Versus` remains the lazy,
  dealer-relative composer; `Table` is the full-board driver and deliberately
  not a `System` (the trait speaks relative vulnerability).
- `Trie::merge`: structural union for assembling a system from separately
  authored fragments (uncontested core + competitive packages). On collision
  `self` keeps its classifier and the keys are reported back; fallback lists
  concatenate with `self`'s first; `Arc`s are reused.
- `classifier`, `guard`, and `rewriter`: identity functions giving plain
  closures the higher-ranked `&Context`/`&[Call]` signature the compiler
  cannot generalize on its own.
- `bidding::american`: the first concrete, reusable system —
  `american()` builds a `Pair` (family `NATURAL`) for basic Two-over-One
  Game Forcing (re-exported as `pons::american`). It covers the uncontested openings
  (strong 15–17 / 20–21 notrumps, strong artificial 2♣, five-card majors,
  better-minor 1♣/1♦, weak twos, preempts, a lighter 3rd/4th-seat major), the
  first response to every one-level opening (the 2/1 game force, the forcing
  1NT, single/limit/Jacoby-2NT/weak-jump raises, 1♠ over 1♥, four-card majors
  up the line over a minor), the 1NT structure (Stayman and Jacoby transfers
  with their opener completions), one round of opener's rebids (after a
  one-level new suit and the forcing 1NT), negative doubles with "system on
  over their double", and a defensive book (natural overcalls, takeout
  doubles, the 15–18 1NT overcall, simple advances, and a penalty-oriented
  defense to their 1NT). The public sub-builders `openings`, `major_responses`,
  `minor_responses`, `notrump_responses`, and `defense_to_suit` return `Rules`
  for reuse and testing, and `competition()` returns the `Competitive` book.
  Authored entirely from the existing vocabulary; no new infrastructure. A
  `american` example (`cargo run --example american`) bids out random
  boards end to end with both sides playing the system, seated via
  `Table::of_pairs`.
- `bidding::american`: the system is now a complete 2/1 card rather than
  a basic slice. New in this pass, each in its own submodule:
  - **2/1 game-force continuations** through the slam-try level: opener's
    rebids after every two-level response (jump rebid, raise, six-card
    rebid, 12–14/18–19 2NT, new suits up the line), responder's rebids
    (trump-setting 3M, second-suit raises, 3NT), opener's 4NT hook once
    trump is set, and an `Undisturbed`-guarded *game backstop* so no
    uncovered game-forcing continuation dies below game.
  - **Forcing 1NT continuations**: the three-card limit raise (1NT then
    3M), 2NT invites, weak six-card runouts, preference, and opener's
    accept/decline.
  - **Jacoby 2NT rebids**: side-suit shortness at the three level, a good
    five-card second suit at the four level, 3M (18+) / 3NT (15–17) with no
    shortness, 4M minimum; responder drives with 4NT.
  - **Splinters** (double jump = four trumps, 10–13, singleton/void),
    **inverted minors**, and **weak jump shifts** (6-card suit, 2–5 HCP),
    with opener continuations.
  - **The strong 2♣ structure**: 2♦ waiting, 2♥ double negative (0–3),
    natural five-card positives and the 2NT balanced positive; opener's
    natural rebids (2NT = 22–24, 3NT = 25–27) and responder continuations.
  - **The 2NT machinery** at every strength: three-level Stayman and Jacoby
    transfers over the 2NT opening *and* the 2♣–2x–2NT rebids ("system
    on"), plus quantitative 4NT raises over 1NT, 2NT, and the 18–19 2NT
    rebid, with opener's graded accept/decline.
  - **Weak-two continuations**: Ogust 2NT (min/max × bad/good suit, 3NT =
    solid), RONF preemptive raises, forcing new suits with opener's reply.
  - **RKCB 1430** below every major-suit trump agreement (after Jacoby
    rebids, splinters, game-force trump setting, and the 2♣ major raise):
    the 1430 answers, asker continuations with a documented 0/3–1/4
    ambiguity policy, the 5NT king ask, and grand-slam decisions.
  - **Fuller competition**: cue-bid (limit-plus) raises, preemptive jump
    raises, competitive raises, negative doubles over all four openings
    (system on over their double everywhere), weak jump shifts in
    competition, support doubles/redoubles (exactly three-card support),
    and opener's forced answer to a negative double.
  - **Two-suited defense**: Michaels cue-bids and the unusual 2NT with
    longer-suit advances and game jumps, plus responsive doubles after
    partner's takeout double and their raise.

  Still left for later passes: lebensohl and reopening actions in deeper
  competitive auctions, responder's natural rebids after `1m–1M–2m`, and
  minor-suit keycard.
- `bidding::constraint`: four new public primitives — `top_honors(suit,
  range)` (count of A/K/Q for suit quality), `stopper_in(suit)`,
  `partner_suit_is(suit)` (pins partner's last bid suit, where `support`
  only grades it), and `min_level_is(level, strain)` (the legality anchor
  for rules whose call sits at a dynamic level, such as cue bids).

### Changed

- **Breaking** (within this release's 2/1 card, never published in an earlier
  version): raise meanings moved to the
  modern defaults. `1m–2m` is now the strong inverted raise (10+, forcing)
  and `1m–3m` the weak preemptive one; direct `1M–3M` limit raises promise
  four trumps, with the three-card limit raise routed through the forcing
  1NT.

- Reduced Clippy noise across bidding internals and tests: several small
  closure-coercion/context helpers are now `const fn`, builder-style
  constraint constructors gained `#[must_use]`, doc-code link formatting was
  cleaned up, and float assertions in tests were refactored to robust helper
  predicates instead of direct float equality.

- **Breaking:** `Partnership` is replaced by `Pair` + `Stance`, and book
  routing is now three-way via `Phase::of`. `Constructive` answers *only*
  strictly undisturbed auctions; competition over our openings moves out of
  the constructive trie into the new `Competitive` book (`american`'s
  negative doubles and system-on now live in its `competition()` builder).
  Assemble the three books with `Pair::new(family, constructive, competitive,
  defensive)` and bind once against the opponents' family —
  `pair.against(them)` returns the `Stance` that implements `System`; a
  `Pair` itself is authoring material, not a `System`. `american()` now
  returns the `Pair`.
- pons now requires `contract-bridge` 0.1.2 for the newly public
  `Auction::can_push`, the dry-run legality check behind `Table::next_call`.

- **Breaking:** `bidding::trie::Classifier::classify` now takes
  `(Hand, &Context)` instead of
  `(Hand, RelativeVulnerability, CommonPrefixes)`. The context carries the
  vulnerability and (optionally) the common prefixes. Closure classifiers
  change from `|hand, vul| …` to `classifier(|hand, context| …)`.
- **Breaking:** the vulnerability-indexed `Forest` (`[Trie; 4]`, with `from_fn`
  and the `Index<RelativeVulnerability>` impls) and its `SeatClasses` mask are
  removed in favor of `bidding::book`. Vulnerability conditions live in
  constraints (`vulnerable()` / `they_vulnerable()`), seats are explicit leading
  passes in the book key, and seat-dependent strength is a constraint
  (`nth_seat` / `passed_hand`). Author a pair's notes with the role-aware
  books assembled into a `Pair` (see above) instead of a bare `Trie`, which
  stays as the low-level table-model escape hatch (and the way to express
  forcing passes).
- `System for Trie` resolves through fallbacks (`Trie::resolve`) instead of
  exact lookup only, so a trie with fallbacks now answers auctions outside
  its book. `get`, `longest_prefix`, `common_prefixes`, and `suffixes` are
  unchanged. The `System` docs pin the vulnerability convention: `vul` is
  relative to the side to act, and composite systems pass it through
  unchanged.

- **Breaking:** `stats::average_ns_par`'s vulnerability parameter is now
  `contract_bridge::AbsoluteVulnerability` instead of `ddss::Vulnerability`.
  `AbsoluteVulnerability` is a new NS/EW bit set in `contract-bridge` 0.1.1 (now
  the minimum required version) that mirrors the existing `RelativeVulnerability`
  for symmetry. The four values map one-to-one — replace
  `ddss::Vulnerability::{NONE, NS, EW, ALL}` with the same constants on
  `contract_bridge::AbsoluteVulnerability`. The double-dummy solver is unchanged
  (still `ddss`).
- `bidding::instinct` learned to bid opposite our own strong notrump: it
  completes a standard transfer (Jacoby 2♦/2♥, 3♦/3♥ over 2NT, South African
  Texas 4♣/4♦) and, rather than pass a *forced* game out, bids the cheapest
  game — a six-card major, else 3NT — when a responder holds game values
  opposite a 15–17 1NT / 20–21 2NT, or when opener is forced past invitation.
  This is the one convention instinct reads, so the deep BTU / strawberry 1NT
  structures stay sound even where the book does not author every continuation.
  Authored rules and weak hands are unaffected: the floor is reached last and
  still defaults to Pass below an invitation.
- `notrump::register` split into `register_one_nt` (the 1NT-opening response
  block) and `register_two_nt_and_rebids` (the 2NT-strength and 18–19-rebid
  structures), so the strawberry variant can swap in BTU for the former while
  reusing the latter. `american()` is unchanged.
- `american()` attaches the instinct floor (see `bidding::instinct` under
  *Added*) to its competitive and defensive books as a root `Always`
  fallback, so the bound stance never falls off the book in a contested
  auction. Auctions that previously classified as `None` — and so were passed
  by drivers, including passing partner's takeout double on a worthless hand
  — now get a natural answer: their three-level preempts, jump overcalls past
  the negative-double range, and deep competitive continuations among them.
  Authored rules are unaffected: resolution reaches the root fallback last.
  The standalone `competition()` and `defensive()` builders stay floor-less.
- The `defend-2sx-or-3nt` example is now a flavor-comparison harness for the
  `(2♠) X (P)` defend-vs-declare decision. West's weak-two opening still comes
  from the real `american` system, while North's takeout double and South's
  Pass-vs-3NT advance are swept across alternative *flavors* — Shape / Support /
  Sound doubles and Defense / Balanced / Offense responses — each written as a
  crisp constraint in the `bidding::constraint` vocabulary. It reports
  per-double-flavor population stats and per-response-policy regret against a
  double-dummy oracle.
- The `defend-2sx-or-3nt` example studies a *realistic* population and plays
  realistic auctions. Deals are accepted through a four-gate funnel — West
  opens 2♠ per the system (at the table's actual vulnerability, via `Table`),
  North doubles by a swept flavor, *East's pass over the double is the
  system's own call* (deals where East would raise never reach South), and
  *South's decision is live* (the system's advance over `(2♠) X (P)` is Pass
  or 3NT, not a suit bid or an escape). Neither branch assumes the auction
  stops at South's call: the table bids both continuations out with
  `Table::bid_out_from` — West may run from the penalty pass, East/West may
  double 3NT or sacrifice — and the *final* contract is scored with
  `scoring::final_contract` / `scoring::ns_score`. New divergence telemetry
  reports how often (and where) the bid-outs left the nominal 2♠×/3NT
  contracts. The funnel is far tighter than the old gate, so
  `--max-attempts-per-deal` now defaults to 20000 (was 5000); numbers are not
  comparable with earlier runs — the live population is markedly more
  NS-favorable, and the swept response policies now beat both trivial
  baselines instead of losing to "always 3NT".
- docs.rs now documents the crate with `--all-features`
  (`[package.metadata.docs.rs]`), so the `serde` impls appear in the rendered
  docs.

### Fixed

- The defensive book's entry tables are now seat-fanned. `defense_to_suit`,
  `defense_to_weak_two`, `defense_to_notrump`, and the advances of natural
  overcalls were keyed only at the raw opening with no leading passes, so
  they answered only when the opponents opened in *first seat*; with any
  leading pass — `(P) 1♦`, our dealer passing first — the same decisions fell
  off the book (and before the instinct floor, were silently passed). Found
  by the first run of the `instinct-floor` telemetry.
- Broken intra-doc links in `bidding::american`: replaced the unresolvable
  `[`slam`]` reference (a private module) with plain backtick notation, and
  qualified `[`Pair::against`]` with its full crate path so rustdoc can resolve
  it from `competition`. The strawberry builder's links to its private
  convention modules (`stenberg`, `btu_notrump`, `rubens`, the `notrump`
  register blocks) likewise became plain backticks, and the `bidding::instinct`
  links now disambiguate the module from the `instinct()` function.
- Seat-fan coverage gaps: responses and continuations now answer after
  4th-seat openings (leading-pass fan extended to three passes), and the
  defensive book answers when their opening arrives after leading passes —
  previously `[P, 1♦]` and kin were silently off-book.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Replace the `dds-bridge` dependency with `ddss` (a
  performance-oriented DDS fork) and the `dds-bridge-sys` dev-dependency
  with `ddss-sys`. Most public types are structurally compatible — `Par`,
  `ParContract`, `TrickCountTable`, `TrickCountRow`, and `Vulnerability` all
  live at the same paths under `ddss::*` — so downstream callers usually
  only need to swap the crate name in imports. Two shape changes:
  - `dds_bridge::Solver::default()` → `ddss::Solver::lock()`. The new
    handle holds a reentrant lock, so its solve methods take `&self` (drop
    the `mut`) and the type is `!Send`.
  - The free `dds_bridge::solve_deals(&deals)` is now a method that takes
    a non-empty strain selector: `Solver::lock().solve_deals(&deals,
    NonEmptyStrainFlags::ALL)` reproduces the old all-strains behavior.
  `calculate_par` remains a free function with the same signature and can
  be called with or without a held `Solver` (it acquires the global ddss
  lock internally; the lock is reentrant per thread).
- **Breaking:** Auction primitives (`Call`, `Auction`, `IllegalCall`,
  `RelativeVulnerability`, and their parse errors), the entire `eval`
  module (`HandEvaluator`, `SimpleEvaluator`, `hcp`, `shortness`,
  `fifths`, `bumrap`, `ltc`, `nltc`, `zar`, `hcp_plus`, `FIFTHS`,
  `BUMRAP`, `BUMRAP_PLUS`, `NLTC`), and the entire `deck` module
  (`Deck`, `full_deal`, `FillDeals`, `fill_deals`) move into the new
  `contract-bridge` crate. Update imports such as
  `use pons::bidding::Call;` → `use contract_bridge::auction::Call;`,
  `use pons::eval::hcp;` → `use contract_bridge::eval::hcp;`, and
  `use pons::deck::full_deal;` →
  `use contract_bridge::deck::full_deal;`.
- **Breaking:** `pons` no longer re-exports bridge data types
  (`Hand`, `Strain`, `Bid`, `Seat`, etc.) — these live in the new
  `contract-bridge` crate, not `dds-bridge`. Replace
  `use dds_bridge::Hand;` with `use contract_bridge::Hand;`.
- Track `dds-bridge`'s flattening of the `solver` module to the crate
  root: `dds_bridge::solver::*` imports become `dds_bridge::*` (e.g.
  `dds_bridge::solver::Vulnerability` → `dds_bridge::Vulnerability`).
- Relocated tests that exercised only lower-crate APIs out of `pons`,
  so failures point at the crate they actually cover. `tests/eval.rs`,
  `tests/deck.rs`, `tests/proptest_roundtrip.rs`, and `tests/solver.rs`
  are removed; the auction block in `tests/bidding.rs` and the
  contract-bridge/ddss serde tests in `tests/serde.rs` are removed in
  place, leaving only `Array`/`Map`/`Logits` tests and pons stats serde
  respectively. The moved tests now live in `contract-bridge` (auction,
  deck, eval, proptest, serde) and `ddss`/`dds-bridge` (large-batch
  solver). No behavior or public-API change in pons.
- Dev-dependencies pruned: `approx` and `ddss-sys` are no longer used
  by anything in `pons` and are removed from `Cargo.toml`.

### Removed

- `pons::deck` and `pons::eval` modules (moved to `contract-bridge`).
- The crate-root re-exports `Deck`, `full_deal`, `HandEvaluator`,
  `Auction`, `Call` (moved to `contract-bridge`).
- The `generate-deals` and `notrump-tricks` examples. They no longer
  depended on anything in `pons` and now live with the crates they
  actually need: `generate-deals` in
  [`contract-bridge`](https://github.com/jdh8/contract-bridge/tree/main/examples/generate-deals)
  and `notrump-tricks` in
  [`ddss`](https://github.com/jdh8/ddss/tree/main/examples/notrump-tricks)
  (with a [parallel
  copy](https://github.com/jdh8/dds-bridge/tree/main/examples/notrump-tricks)
  in `dds-bridge`).

### Fixed

- README's `average_ns_par` doctest no longer overflows the stack on
  Windows. The fix is in `ddss` 0.1.2 (now the minimum required
  version): the batch solver's FFI packs are allocated directly on the
  heap via `Box::new_zeroed`, instead of routing through a stack
  temporary as `Box::default()` does at opt-level 0.

### Internal

- Set `[profile.dev.package."*"]` to `opt-level = 2`, so dependencies —
  most notably `ddss-sys`'s C++ DDS engine via `cc` — are optimized in
  dev builds. Pons's own Rust stays at opt-level 0 so any future
  stack-temp-class bug in this crate's own code still surfaces under
  `cargo test`. Big speedup for the `average_ns_par` doctest and
  `tests/par.rs`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Bump `dds-bridge` to **0.19** and `dds-bridge-sys` to **3.0**
  (the latter is a dev-dependency used only by `tests/solver.rs`). The
  underlying DDS C++ library moves to v3.0.0 with PascalCase struct names
  and snake_case fields; `pons`'s own safe API is unaffected, but downstream
  users who pin to older versions of these dependencies should also bump
  them in lockstep. See the `dds-bridge-sys` v3.0.0 and `dds-bridge` v0.19.0
  changelogs for the rename map.

### Added
- New `defend-2sx-or-3nt` example: compares the expected NS score from
  defending 2♠× vs declaring 3NT after the auction `(2♠) X (P)`. The
  bidding system is a single `Trie` with three classifiers — West's
  weak-two opening at `[]`, North's takeout double at `[2♠]`, and South's
  natural call at `[2♠, X, P]` (which may be Pass, 3NT, or an
  out-of-scope call such as a 3-level new suit, jump in hearts, or
  Lebensohl 2NT). South's classifier is used only as an eligibility
  filter: deals are rejection-sampled so only those where West opens 2♠,
  North doubles, *and* South naturally faces a P-or-3NT decision are
  kept and double-dummy solved. Each accepted deal is scored under three
  strategies — always defend 2♠×, always declare 3NT, and a per-deal
  oracle that picks the higher of the two — giving an upper bound on
  what any policy keyed on South's hand could achieve. Scoring uses
  `dds_bridge::Contract::score`. Accepts an optional `--south` for
  hand-specific analysis (errors if the hand falls out of scope) or
  randomizes all four seats when omitted.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Updated `dds-bridge` dependency to 0.18
- `full_deal` now returns `FullDeal` (was `Deal`)
- `fill_deals` now takes a pre-validated `PartialDeal`; no longer returns `Result`
- Track `dds-bridge`'s trick-count rename: `solver::TricksTable` → `solver::TrickCountTable` in `stats::HistogramTable`'s `FromIterator` impl and in the `check-zar` / `check-nltc` examples. Pure rename on the consumer side.
- The `serde` feature now also pulls in `serde_with` (optional dep).

### Internal
- Replaced the last hand-written `serde_impl` submodule (on `Deck`) with `serde_with::SerializeDisplay` / `DeserializeFromStr` derives. No change to the serialized form.
- Replaced non-const `.unwrap()` in tests and the `Auction::declarer` doctest with `?` propagation. Tests with a single fallible error type return `Result<(), E>`; tests mixing error types or unwrapping `Option` return `anyhow::Result<()>`.
- Moved inline `mod tests` blocks in `bidding.rs` and `deck.rs` into dedicated `bidding/tests.rs` and `deck/tests.rs` files. No behavior change.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Optional `serde` feature for serialization/deserialization support
- `Display` and `FromStr` implementations for `Deck` and bidding types
- `Classifier` promoted to a trait (was a plain `fn` in 0.5.0)
- Constructors for `Forest`
- `FusedIterator` implementation for `Trie` iterators
- `Debug` on `Trie` and iterator types
- Slicing API for `Auction`; `Index<Range<Bid>>` and bid-range indexing on `Array`
- `Logits::softmax` (replaces `to_odds`); returns `None` when all logits are `-∞`
- `fill_deals` helper
- Criterion benchmarks for shuffle, trie, and parallel solving
- proptest-based roundtrip and histogram invariant tests

### Changed
- `System::classify` now takes a slice
- `Auction::push` is panicking; confusing `force_push` removed
- `Deck` rejects duplicate cards
- `RelativeVulnerability` renamed from previous type
- Converters borrow instead of consuming
- Public fields replaced with getters
- Error types marked `#[non_exhaustive]`
- `average_ns_par` return type improved; redundant count parameter removed
- Random deal generation moved to `dds-bridge`; local `solver` module renamed to `random`
- Deterministic stats moved to `mod stats`
- MSRV pinned to 1.93
- Updated `dds-bridge` dependency to 0.16

### Fixed
- Memory leak in `Array::try_map`
- `hcp_plus` calculation

### Internal
- Added `#[inline]` to trivial getters on `Copy` types
- Aligned `HistogramRow::count` to take `self` (non-breaking: `HistogramRow: Copy`)
- Deduplicated `Map::get_mut`
- Bidding context lives with the stored classifier; shared API between systems and classifiers
- Hardened GitHub workflow; CI enforces `fmt`, `clippy`, and doc warnings
- Expanded README; documented the `map` module

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `Array<T>` modeling `Call -> T`, with `Array`-like and full iterator API
- `Map` with iteration over keys, values, and entries; separated iteration for arrays
- `Logits` module (under `mod array`); `Logits::to_odds`
- Abstract bidding table supporting multiple calls per node
- Classifier concept (as a plain `fn`) replacing the filter-based approach
- Own `bidding::Vulnerability` type
- Absolute `bidding::Frequency` for easier filtering
- Different indices for X (double) and XX (redouble)

### Changed
- Edition updated to Rust 2024
- Magic number 38 replaced with a named constant

## [0.3.1] — 2025-05-31

### Fixed
- `Strategy` now requires `RefUnwindSafe` so `Trie` stays `UnwindSafe`

### Internal
- Inlined small functions for optimization

## [0.3.0] — 2025-05-30

### Added
- Core bridge data structures: `Card`, `Suit`, `Hand`, `Deck`, `Holding`
- `SmallSet` trait for `Holding` and `Hand`
- DDS (double-dummy solver) integration via `dds-bridge`
- Contract scoring
- Bitset operators for `Holding` and `Hand`
- Basic CLI to solve random deals
- Hand evaluation (LTC, NLTC, BUM-RAP, Zar points)
- `Auction` with `push`, `pop`, and `truncate`
- `Trie` for bidding strategies, with depth-first iteration, suffix and prefix iterators
- Statistics utilities for evaluators; histograms
