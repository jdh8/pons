# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Relocated tests that exercised only lower-crate APIs out of `pons`,
  so failures point at the crate they actually cover. `tests/eval.rs`,
  `tests/deck.rs`, `tests/proptest_roundtrip.rs`, and `tests/solver.rs`
  are removed; the auction block in `tests/bidding.rs` and the
  contract-bridge/ddss serde tests in `tests/serde.rs` are removed in
  place, leaving only `Array`/`Map`/`Logits` tests and pons stats serde
  respectively. The moved tests now live in `contract-bridge` (auction,
  deck, eval, proptest, serde) and `ddss`/`dds-bridge` (large-batch
  solver). No behavior or public-API change in pons.
- Dev-dependencies pruned: `approx` and `ddss-sys` are no longer used
  by anything in `pons` and are removed from `Cargo.toml`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Replace the `dds-bridge` dependency with `ddss` (a
  performance-oriented DDS fork) and the `dds-bridge-sys` dev-dependency
  with `ddss-sys`. Most public types are structurally compatible — `Par`,
  `ParContract`, `TrickCountTable`, `TrickCountRow`, and `Vulnerability` all
  live at the same paths under `ddss::*` — so downstream callers usually
  only need to swap the crate name in imports. Two shape changes:
  - `dds_bridge::Solver::default()` → `ddss::Solver::lock()`. The new
    handle holds a reentrant lock, so its solve methods take `&self` (drop
    the `mut`) and the type is `!Send`.
  - The free `dds_bridge::solve_deals(&deals)` is now a method that takes
    a non-empty strain selector: `Solver::lock().solve_deals(&deals,
    NonEmptyStrainFlags::ALL)` reproduces the old all-strains behavior.
  `calculate_par` remains a free function with the same signature and can
  be called with or without a held `Solver` (it acquires the global ddss
  lock internally; the lock is reentrant per thread).
- **Breaking:** Auction primitives (`Call`, `Auction`, `IllegalCall`,
  `RelativeVulnerability`, and their parse errors), the entire `eval`
  module (`HandEvaluator`, `SimpleEvaluator`, `hcp`, `shortness`,
  `fifths`, `bumrap`, `ltc`, `nltc`, `zar`, `hcp_plus`, `FIFTHS`,
  `BUMRAP`, `BUMRAP_PLUS`, `NLTC`), and the entire `deck` module
  (`Deck`, `full_deal`, `FillDeals`, `fill_deals`) move into the new
  `contract-bridge` crate. Update imports such as
  `use pons::bidding::Call;` → `use contract_bridge::auction::Call;`,
  `use pons::eval::hcp;` → `use contract_bridge::eval::hcp;`, and
  `use pons::deck::full_deal;` →
  `use contract_bridge::deck::full_deal;`.
- **Breaking:** `pons` no longer re-exports bridge data types
  (`Hand`, `Strain`, `Bid`, `Seat`, etc.) — these live in the new
  `contract-bridge` crate, not `dds-bridge`. Replace
  `use dds_bridge::Hand;` with `use contract_bridge::Hand;`.
- Track `dds-bridge`'s flattening of the `solver` module to the crate
  root: `dds_bridge::solver::*` imports become `dds_bridge::*` (e.g.
  `dds_bridge::solver::Vulnerability` → `dds_bridge::Vulnerability`).

### Removed

- `pons::deck` and `pons::eval` modules (moved to `contract-bridge`).
- The crate-root re-exports `Deck`, `full_deal`, `HandEvaluator`,
  `Auction`, `Call` (moved to `contract-bridge`).
- The `generate-deals` and `notrump-tricks` examples. They no longer
  depended on anything in `pons` and now live with the crates they
  actually need: `generate-deals` in
  [`contract-bridge`](https://github.com/jdh8/contract-bridge/tree/main/examples/generate-deals)
  and `notrump-tricks` in
  [`ddss`](https://github.com/jdh8/ddss/tree/main/examples/notrump-tricks)
  (with a [parallel
  copy](https://github.com/jdh8/dds-bridge/tree/main/examples/notrump-tricks)
  in `dds-bridge`).

### Fixed

- README's `average_ns_par` doctest no longer overflows the stack on
  Windows. The fix is in `ddss` 0.1.2 (now the minimum required
  version): the batch solver's FFI packs are allocated directly on the
  heap via `Box::new_zeroed`, instead of routing through a stack
  temporary as `Box::default()` does at opt-level 0.

### Internal

- Set `[profile.dev.package."*"]` to `opt-level = 2`, so dependencies —
  most notably `ddss-sys`'s C++ DDS engine via `cc` — are optimized in
  dev builds. Pons's own Rust stays at opt-level 0 so any future
  stack-temp-class bug in this crate's own code still surfaces under
  `cargo test`. Big speedup for the `average_ns_par` doctest and
  `tests/par.rs`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Bump `dds-bridge` to **0.19** and `dds-bridge-sys` to **3.0**
  (the latter is a dev-dependency used only by `tests/solver.rs`). The
  underlying DDS C++ library moves to v3.0.0 with PascalCase struct names
  and snake_case fields; `pons`'s own safe API is unaffected, but downstream
  users who pin to older versions of these dependencies should also bump
  them in lockstep. See the `dds-bridge-sys` v3.0.0 and `dds-bridge` v0.19.0
  changelogs for the rename map.

### Added
- New `defend-2sx-or-3nt` example: compares the expected NS score from
  defending 2♠× vs declaring 3NT after the auction `(2♠) X (P)`. The
  bidding system is a single `Trie` with three classifiers — West's
  weak-two opening at `[]`, North's takeout double at `[2♠]`, and South's
  natural call at `[2♠, X, P]` (which may be Pass, 3NT, or an
  out-of-scope call such as a 3-level new suit, jump in hearts, or
  Lebensohl 2NT). South's classifier is used only as an eligibility
  filter: deals are rejection-sampled so only those where West opens 2♠,
  North doubles, *and* South naturally faces a P-or-3NT decision are
  kept and double-dummy solved. Each accepted deal is scored under three
  strategies — always defend 2♠×, always declare 3NT, and a per-deal
  oracle that picks the higher of the two — giving an upper bound on
  what any policy keyed on South's hand could achieve. Scoring uses
  `dds_bridge::Contract::score`. Accepts an optional `--south` for
  hand-specific analysis (errors if the hand falls out of scope) or
  randomizes all four seats when omitted.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Updated `dds-bridge` dependency to 0.18
- `full_deal` now returns `FullDeal` (was `Deal`)
- `fill_deals` now takes a pre-validated `PartialDeal`; no longer returns `Result`
- Track `dds-bridge`'s trick-count rename: `solver::TricksTable` → `solver::TrickCountTable` in `stats::HistogramTable`'s `FromIterator` impl and in the `check-zar` / `check-nltc` examples. Pure rename on the consumer side.
- The `serde` feature now also pulls in `serde_with` (optional dep).

### Internal
- Replaced the last hand-written `serde_impl` submodule (on `Deck`) with `serde_with::SerializeDisplay` / `DeserializeFromStr` derives. No change to the serialized form.
- Replaced non-const `.unwrap()` in tests and the `Auction::declarer` doctest with `?` propagation. Tests with a single fallible error type return `Result<(), E>`; tests mixing error types or unwrapping `Option` return `anyhow::Result<()>`.
- Moved inline `mod tests` blocks in `bidding.rs` and `deck.rs` into dedicated `bidding/tests.rs` and `deck/tests.rs` files. No behavior change.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Optional `serde` feature for serialization/deserialization support
- `Display` and `FromStr` implementations for `Deck` and bidding types
- `Classifier` promoted to a trait (was a plain `fn` in 0.5.0)

- `FusedIterator` implementation for `Trie` iterators
- `Debug` on `Trie` and iterator types
- Slicing API for `Auction`; `Index<Range<Bid>>` and bid-range indexing on `Array`

- `fill_deals` helper
- Criterion benchmarks for shuffle, trie, and parallel solving
- proptest-based roundtrip and histogram invariant tests

### Changed
- `System::classify` now takes a slice

- MSRV pinned to 1.93
- Updated `dds-bridge` dependency to 0.16

### Fixed
- Memory leak in `Array::try_map`
- `hcp_plus` calculation

### Internal
- Added `#[inline]` to trivial getters on `Copy` types
- Aligned `HistogramRow::count` to take `self` (non-breaking: `HistogramRow: Copy`)
- Deduplicated `Map::get_mut`
- Bidding context lives with the stored classifier; shared API between systems and classifiers
- Hardened GitHub workflow; CI enforces `fmt`, `clippy`, and doc warnings
- Expanded README; documented the `map` module

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `Array<T>` modeling `Call -> T`, with `Array`-like and full iterator API
