# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated `dds-bridge` dependency to 0.18
- `full_deal` now returns `FullDeal` (was `Deal`)
- `fill_deals` now takes a pre-validated `PartialDeal`; no longer returns `Result`

### Internal
- Moved serde submodules to separate files

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Optional `serde` feature for serialization/deserialization support
- `Display` and `FromStr` implementations for `Deck` and bidding types
- `Classifier` promoted to a trait (was a plain `fn` in 0.5.0)
- Constructors for `Forest`
- `FusedIterator` implementation for `Trie` iterators
- `Debug` on `Trie` and iterator types
- Slicing API for `Auction`; `Index<Range<Bid>>` and bid-range indexing on `Array`
- `Logits::softmax` (replaces `to_odds`); returns `None` when all logits are `-∞`
- `fill_deals` helper
- Criterion benchmarks for shuffle, trie, and parallel solving
- proptest-based roundtrip and histogram invariant tests

### Changed
- `System::classify` now takes a slice
- `Auction::push` is panicking; confusing `force_push` removed
- `Deck` rejects duplicate cards
- `RelativeVulnerability` renamed from previous type
- Converters borrow instead of consuming
- Public fields replaced with getters
- Error types marked `#[non_exhaustive]`
- `average_ns_par` return type improved; redundant count parameter removed
- Random deal generation moved to `dds-bridge`; local `solver` module renamed to `random`
- Deterministic stats moved to `mod stats`
- MSRV pinned to 1.93
- Updated `dds-bridge` dependency to 0.16

### Fixed
- Memory leak in `Array::try_map`
- `hcp_plus` calculation

### Internal
- Added `#[inline]` to trivial getters on `Copy` types
- Aligned `HistogramRow::count` to take `self` (non-breaking: `HistogramRow: Copy`)
- Deduplicated `Map::get_mut`
- Bidding context lives with the stored classifier; shared API between systems and classifiers
- Hardened GitHub workflow; CI enforces `fmt`, `clippy`, and doc warnings
- Expanded README; documented the `map` module

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `Array<T>` modeling `Call -> T`, with `Array`-like and full iterator API
- `Map` with iteration over keys, values, and entries; separated iteration for arrays
- `Logits` module (under `mod array`); `Logits::to_odds`
- Abstract bidding table supporting multiple calls per node
- Classifier concept (as a plain `fn`) replacing the filter-based approach
- Own `bidding::Vulnerability` type
- Absolute `bidding::Frequency` for easier filtering
- Different indices for X (double) and XX (redouble)

### Changed
- Edition updated to Rust 2024
- Magic number 38 replaced with a named constant

## [0.3.1] — 2025-05-31

### Fixed
- `Strategy` now requires `RefUnwindSafe` so `Trie` stays `UnwindSafe`

### Internal
- Inlined small functions for optimization

## [0.3.0] — 2025-05-30

### Added
- Core bridge data structures: `Card`, `Suit`, `Hand`, `Deck`, `Holding`
- `SmallSet` trait for `Holding` and `Hand`
- DDS (double-dummy solver) integration via `dds-bridge`
- Contract scoring
- Bitset operators for `Holding` and `Hand`
- Basic CLI to solve random deals
- Hand evaluation (LTC, NLTC, BUM-RAP, Zar points)
- `Auction` with `push`, `pop`, and `truncate`
- `Trie` for bidding strategies, with depth-first iteration, suffix and prefix iterators
- Statistics utilities for evaluators; histograms
